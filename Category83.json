I was simply doingmy job like the director had asked me to when I heard him yell, &#8220;I love Casper!&#8221;. He was a smallboy of three who was grinning from ear to ear. Once the credits rolled over, I sneaked out of thescreen discreetly and followed him. He had held his parent&#8217;s hand while he excitedly shared hisappreciation for the movie and its ghosts. My translucent chest had swelled up with pride. I sawAndrew looking back a couple oftimes, probably sensing my presence as he left the complex.But I would quickly hide behind a wall or a pillar. But he managed to catch me and threw a smilein my direction. His dad sat in the driver seat while his mum tucked him in his baby seat in theback of his car. Andrew signalled me to hurry up so I hastily snuck past his mum and sat next tohim. Both of us snickered as the car drove on, and that is how our friendship began.<\/p><p>We used to play for hours at his house. He was still learning how to use the swing set in hiscommunity playground in the early phase of our friendship. I remember how sad he was whenall his friends could swing by themselves while he had to rely on his parents to push him everyfew seconds. I could not bear to see him look hopeless so I would sneak out of the bush andpush his swing a couple of times before hiding behind the bush again. I can still recall hislaughter as he went high up in the air.<\/p><p>Everything was perfect until he began going to school. I had never been away fromhim for solong. When I told Andrew how much I missed playing with him all day, he asked me to hideinside his school bag and promised to take me with him the following day. His school was huge;there were plenty of other kids as well, more than those inthe park. I used to sit under his desksuch that his classmates won&#8217;t notice me. During playtime, a group of kids played outside whilesome stayed inside to play with toys. Andrew told me how he was afraid to make friends andhow he missed his mum dearly.I remember grabbing his hand and pulling him towards theplayground. Once there, I asked him to show the kids some of his spiderman stickers. He wasshy at first but mustered up some courage and walked towards them. Within minutes everyonehad surrounded him to look at those sparkling stickers. From the sea of tiny heads, his grinningface popped out while his bright eyes thanked me for my genius idea.<\/p><p>Apart from this major success, I would not say school was a good place for friends like me. MyAndrew spent most of his time interacting with his classmates or drawing masterpieces on anA4 sheet of paper. He was a good kid and tried to talk to me every chance he got, but he couldnot give me the attention I once received. This made me commit the biggest mistake of my life-I told him I wanted to stay at his house and not come to his school anymore because I gotbored. I felt I would enjoy playing with his hot wheels and barbies more than with him at school.It was fun for a few days, not having to be squished between his books in his bag or squattingunder his desk but getting to sleep in his soft bed till noon and eating his favourite cookies. Butthat meant I would not see Andrew for hours and had to stay alone in his massive scary house.Little did I knowthat what was about to happen was scarier than the empty house.<\/p><p>Within a few weeks, I started noticing how distant Andrew had been from me. He no longerlooked around for me in the park, instead he tried to find his friends there. Even during dinner,Andrew would not talk to me much. The worst part was that he had forgotten about our late-night stargazing sessions since he used to be exhausted by bedtime. He started bringing hisfriends over more often. I had tried talking to some of his friends, but I think they were a littlesnooty since they never responded. I even tried copying their mannerisms so that Andrew wouldnotice me but his eyes seemed to look past my translucent body.<\/p><p>I would have still lived this way if I had not noticed how my once big bulbous head had nowstarted shrinking while my little pinky finger had disappeared. There was only one explanationfor this problem; Andrew no longer needed me. I was heartbroken. I was supposed to be angryat him for robbing me of his friendship, but all I could feel was pain. I used to think about what I could have done differently to avoid this problem. But I soon realised it was of no use. After all, I was just an imaginary friend.<\/p>\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/section>\n\t\t\t\t<section

People were living in fear and angst. Unfortunately, due to lack of evidence and witnesses, even this case was going to the pile of unsolved cases registered in Vadodara. Ten murders were committed in a short span of 2months.<\/p>\n<p class=\"normal\">Aditya, the head officer of Vadodara Police Department was disappointed and disgusted by his department&#8217;s inefficiency to bring justice for his people. In reality, he was unable to accept his failure.<\/p>\n<p class=\"normal\">He walks out of the station and takes a quick drag from his Marlboro. Trying to stabilise his anger. Patil who was the constable of VPD(Vadodara Police Department) calls Aditya back to the police station.<\/p>\n<p class=\"normal\">&#8220;Sir, it&#8217;s the state investigation agency on the line.<\/p>\n<p class=\"normal\">&#8220;again!&#8221;<\/p>\n<p class=\"normal\">It was the consecutive calling from the investigation which pissed him off.<\/p>\n<p class=\"normal\">He takes a quick drag and walks back to answer the call.<\/p>\n<p class=\"normal\">&#8220;Mr Aditya, This is Vivek Rathod, commissioner of State Investigation Agency(SIA).<\/p>\n<p class=\"normal\">It looks like you are not able to slay the demons of your town.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p class=\"normal\">Rathod&#8217;s voice was fruity with an authoritative tone.<\/p>\n<p class=\"normal\">&#8220;Sir I think I will be able to handle it if you give me some more time&#8230;&#8221;<\/p>\n<p class=\"normal\">&#8220;I am sending one of my detectives to help you out. I hope you and VPD will cooperate. Thank you.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p class=\"normal\">Without waiting for a response, Rathod ended the call. Aditya banged his fist ferociously on the table.<\/p>\n<p class=\"normal\">Anyone could guess that he was cussing Rathod in his thoughts very badly.<\/p>\n<p class=\"normal\">\n<\/p><p class=\"normal\">&#8220;I don&#8217;t understand how can someone be so arrogant! They don&#8217;t know anything about our city. This officer from SIA will waste our freaking time and nothing else.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p class=\"normal\">Patil took a deep breath and replied &#8220;Sir but we have to solve this case as soon as possible and some help wouldn&#8217;t be that bad. Right sir?<\/p>\n<p class=\"normal\">&#8220;I think you are right, Patil. I am pushing myself and the whole staff mercilessly&#8221;<\/p>\n<p class=\"normal\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"normal\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">The next day<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"normal\">Vijay Shekhawat hopped out from his matt black BMW which had the SIA logo on its windshield.<\/p>\n<p class=\"normal\">Combining his wide upper frame with his 5&#8217;11 tall stature, Vijay looked like a man of authority and integrity. A scar above his eye was making him look more barbarous. His smile was in complete contrast with his personality. No matter how manly he looked, his smile was childish, full of innocence.<\/p>\n<p class=\"normal\">&#8220;I am Aditya, Head officer of VPD.<\/p>\n<p class=\"normal\">&#8221; Vijay Shekhawat senior detective at SIA. let&#8217;s start the meeting, we are already running short with time.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p class=\"normal\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><b>&nbsp;<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"normal\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><b>Case briefing session at VPD(Vadodara Police Department)<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"normal\"><span style=\"color: var( --e-global-color-text );\">Aditya took a deep breath and started describing the crucial information related to the case.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"normal\">&#8220;What we are looking at here is Manushi Malhotra&#8217;s murder case which according to the forensic report took place on 20th November. Her body was first seen by a local delivery boy. Nothing important came through his interrogation. She was an orphan and had a husband with whom she separated 2 years back. Her husband left the country in the same month they got separated. She had some casual friends but they didn&#8217;t know anything about Manushi&#8217;s personal life. According to reports, no fingerprints were found near the body. Her wound tells us that she was stabbed with a sharp knife or Katana which pierced her belly. Loss of blood was the reason behind her death. We checked the house, nothing critical for this case was found.&#8221;<\/p><p class=\"normal\"><br><\/p>\n<p class=\"normal\">&#8220;What are your thoughts on this, Vijay&#8221;<\/p>\n<p class=\"normal\">Vijay was about to speak something but got interrupted by Aditya. He went on in with his exhausted voice, &#8221; Please don&#8217;t think that the delivery boy might have killed her, emptied her locker and acted as a spectator which will make him the least suspected person. Guess what, we have already searched his house plus his recent bank transactions. He is clear.<\/p>\n<p class=\"normal\"><br><\/p><p class=\"normal\">&#8220;No, I was going to say&#8230;&#8221; Vijay tried to speak but was again interrupted by Aaditya.<\/p>\n<p class=\"normal\">&#8221; Oh, So you might be thinking that his Husband with whom she ended with a rough note might have come to seek his revenge. Like the old revenge stories, huh? Then listen, He was in the state when the crime was committed! But guess what he was staying in a place 300km away. My team checked the CCTVs of the hotel in which he was staying. They found nothing suspicious at all.<\/p>\n<p class=\"normal\">I am telling you, Vijay, this is pretty bad. You don&#8217;t even know how much time and energy I have wasted behind this dead-end case.&#8221; Aditya took a quick sip from his energy drink and sat down. Vijay stood up and went near the whiteboard on which information related to some other cases were written. He rubbed it out and started writing something. He wrote three words in bold handwriting, circling each word heavily.<\/p><p class=\"normal\"><br><\/p>\n<p class=\"normal\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><b>ORPHAN&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DIVORCE&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LONELY<\/b><\/span><\/p><p class=\"normal\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><b><br><\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"normal\">She was an orphan which means she never got a family who loves her. The Love one gets from his mother when she feeds him. She never had a father whose mere existence can make you feel protected and secured. The care and warmth one gets when the whole family is around. The relationship one sees between their parents who might not have a cosy romantic bond but they still managed to hold their hands through disastrous times. And that is more romantic and beautiful than anything else.<\/p>\n<p class=\"normal\"><br><\/p><p class=\"normal\">&#8220;<i>You know what type of trauma is the worst?<\/i><\/p>\n<p class=\"normal\"><i>The trauma which sparkles the wrath of past traumas&#8221;<\/i><\/p>\n<p class=\"normal\">Life downcast her once again. When she got divorced. Incidence like this impacts everyone but imagine the misery it would have created in Manushi&#8217;s life. Whose past life was already messed up? Even the toughest cookie breaks after going through such type of heartbreaking, heart-wrenching and distressful experience. After all this ruckus she was alone in her life.No matter how ignorant some people are who fantasize about loneliness and Lone-wolf crap. <strong><em>Deep down we all know, all of us want to be loved and nothing else.<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<p class=\"normal\">Everyone in the room was dumbstruck and amazed by Vijay&#8217;s theory on the on-going case. Though he was poetic while explaining his views, the facts remain the same. He was right.<\/p>\n<p class=\"normal\">&#8220;Check her medical records. Don&#8217;t just rely on the documents, interrogate her neighbours about her daily routine. She must have taken some medical help. From my point of view, she might be seeing some therapist. I want your team to work relentlessly to find this person. Are you clear, Mr Aditya?&#8221;Aditya was confused and astonished after listening to Vijay&#8217;s take on the case. Still, there was something that was bothering Aditya. He was sweating heavily and taking deep breaths.No matter how hard he was trying to show that he was happy that they were progressing with the case. His face was telling a different story as for a few seconds he was clearly not happy with the revelation. As if some secret which was meant to be forgotten became alive suddenly. He quickly puts on his fake smile and replies&#8221; Yes sir, I will make sure that we find this person as soon as possible.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p class=\"normal\"><i><br><\/i><\/p><p class=\"normal\"><i>Is Aditya hiding something? Is it related to this case?<\/i><\/p>\n<p class=\"normal\"><i>Did he know Manushi before she got murdered? Will Vijay be able to solve this? Is the stranger( Manushi&#8217;s therapist) connected to this case? What will happen next?<\/i><\/p>\n<p><em><strong>Only time will tell. The answers to Manushi&#8217;s present lies in the past.<\/strong><\/em><\/p><\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/section>\n\t\t\t\t<section

All that’s left is a signature from the new proprietors and the house will be all set to be sold. I must say, it’s a really pretty house you have. You must be having some really fond memories with it.” Said the real estate agent.</strong></p><p><strong>“Well not really. It’s a fact that I lived for 20 years in this house. But now that both mom and dad have passed away it’s just a liability I would like to be relieved of as soon as possible. It&#8217;s not worth holding on to stuff that’s no longer useful. Especially an old house with no one to call its own.” Replied Pratik with a smirk on his face.</strong></p><p><strong>Later that night Pratik went into a deep slumber. He suddenly woke outside the gate of his old house. In front of him, he saw a hooded man staring at the house. “Stand up young man.” He said as he stared at the house.</strong></p><p><strong>Pratik stood up. He looked at the house, it was the same house yet it had an aura of unrest surrounding it. The skies were filled with rumbling thunderclouds with the sound of the grasshoppers following them from every direction. Pratik hesitatingly inquired, “Why am I here? What am I doing outside this rusty old house.”</strong></p><p><strong>“Speak less and follow me the sooner we are done here the sooner you will be free. And do not try to walk away from me for if you are lost even I will never be able to find you.” Said the hooded man as he opened the gates of the old house. Pratik followed him and the man took him to the hall first.</strong></p><p><strong>There he saw a man dressed in a cowboy suit. “ Ahoy Pratik boy, long time no see.” Seeing his face Pratik instantly remembered a TV show he used to watch with his family.</strong></p><p><strong>“I know you must be confused, but I am only here to take you down the Hall&#8217;s memory lane. Remember how you used to watch TV here with your mom and dad.”</strong></p><p><strong>Then Pratik suddenly had a flashback of how he slept on his mom’s lap while watching the show and how his dad carried him to the bedroom. “Oh, the pleasure it gave me seeing you all together.” He said as he covered his tearful eyes with his hat. Pratik had a confused yet sorrowful look in his eyes.</strong></p><p><strong>“Come with me. The journey’s not over.” The hooded man said and took him to the kitchen. There a woman in the dress of a waitress was waiting for them.</strong></p><p><strong>“Oh look how skinny you have become. Seems like you haven’t been eating good food since you left…..” And she continued rambling about his health for the next 10 minutes without catching a breath.</strong></p><p><strong>Then she said “Oh look at the time. I am sorry.” Here have a look at what I wish to show you.” She showed him the memory of his birthday and a cake baked by his mother for him with the bliss of innocent happiness on his face.</strong></p><p><strong>“Your mom and dad may not have earned as much as you have throughout their life, but they surely had a lot of wealth to purchase happiness. Take care of yourself, young man.” She said as she placed the palm of her hand on his cheek.</strong></p><p><strong>“Why are you showing me all this? What is the meaning of all this?” he yelled at the hooded man as he sat down grabbing his hair in a state of confusion. “You shall receive all the answers at the end of the journey.” The hooded man replied calmly.</strong></p><p><strong>He then took him to the garden. There he saw an old man who wore a hat and held pruners in his hands looking exactly like a gardener staring at the sky. “Seems like my turn has finally come. You know the drill.”</strong></p><p><strong>The gardener walked up to him, held his hand and showed him a memory of the day he tried the garden swing for the first time and grazed his knee. “During your first time, you increased the speed of the swing so much that you lost your balance at a height and fell. You cried a lot that day kid but so did I.” he sighed and continued staring at the clouds.</strong></p><p><strong>“So who’s next?” Pratik inquired in a gloomy tone as his conscious began to prick him as he tried holding his tears back. “We are close to the end.” Replied the man.</strong></p><p><strong>They then went to his bedroom. There they saw a man who looked exactly like his favourite action figure. “Welcome to the final room kid. Remember me, the red ranger. Your favourite hero. You always hanged my poster on your wall.&#8221;</strong></p><p><strong>He then looked into his eyes and showed him the final memory. The final part was filled with glimpses that brought tears to his eyes. “I have witnessed it all kid. Your heartbreaks, your sickness, your lonesome tears, your struggle everything. I have seen the version of you the world will never witness. Look at those thunderclouds!”</strong></p><p><strong>He pointed towards the window. “Even though the sky is covered by those dark clouds it doesn’t mean the stars aren’t there. And we have a lot of faith in our star.” He added as he looked at the hooded man with a smile. The man turned his face away from him.</strong></p><p><strong>“But….” Just as he was about to say something he was suddenly teleported outside his house again and was surrounded by those four people again.</strong></p><p><strong>“Wait a minute, what is all this? This is all too hard for me to process. Were you guys alive the entire time? And more importantly what are you? Please, someone, tell me something.” He wailed with tears dripping from his eyes as his words were eaten by his overflowing emotions.</strong></p><p><strong>“We are the spirits kid. The very manifestation of the emotions that your parents filled this house with.” Said the cowboy. “You were about to leave us and that made us really sad.” Said the maid. “Of course we knew this day would surely come.” added the gardener. “But all we wanted was for you to leave with happy memories and not discontent towards us. We all wish for your progress. But in return, all we demand is a proper farewell.” Said the superhero.</strong></p><p><strong>“I am sorry. I am sorry for everything I said. For ever mistreating you. And thank you so much for staying by my side all these years.” Said Pratik with his hands joined and tears flowing down his eyes.</strong></p><p><strong>“I understand them all but, who are you hooded guy?” he asked. “ I am the very creator of this house Pratty and frankly I am proud of the way you have grown. Its time for you to return. Goodbye. Don’t forget I am always watching your back” He said in a different yet warm and familiar voice.</strong></p><p><strong>“Pratty, there is only one man in this world who called me that.” He exclaimed. Suddenly the ground beneath him opened up and he fell down into the darkness. He yelled “ Daaaadd…..” as he fell down.</strong></p><p><strong>When he finally woke up, he was perspiring as if he had run a 400 m race. Then he realized that whatever happened, it all occurred in his dream. He started crying again and went back to the house.</strong></p><p><strong>There he spent an hour in every room reliving his past. And finally, before selling the house he refurbished every room as if it were his own. In the end, he bid a final farewell to his old home with all the respect and love it deserved.</strong></p></div>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t</section>\n\t\t\t\t<section class=\"elementor-section elementor-top-section elementor-element elementor-element-868af7d elementor-section-boxed elementor-section-height-default elementor-section-height-default\" data-id=\"868af7d\" data-element_type=\"section\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-container elementor-column-gap-default\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-row\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"aux-parallax-section elementor-column elementor-col-100 elementor-top-column elementor-element elementor-element-b48b288\" data-id=\"b48b288\" data-element_type=\"column\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-column-wrap elementor-element-populated\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-wrap\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-d7c610c elementor-author-box--layout-image-left elementor-author-box--align-left elementor-widget__width-auto elementor-widget-mobile__width-auto elementor-author-box--image-valign-middle elementor-widget elementor-widget-author-box\" data-id=\"d7c610c\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"author-box.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-author-box\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div  class=\"elementor-author-box__avatar\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"https://dduconnect.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/default-user-300x300.png\" alt=\"Mufaddal Suratwala\">\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-author-box__text\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div >\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3 class=\"elementor-author-box__name\">Mufaddal Suratwala</h3>\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-author-box__bio\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>AUTHOR<br />\nIT 4th Sem</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-00489c0 elementor-author-box--layout-image-right elementor-author-box--align-right elementor-widget__width-auto elementor-author-box--image-valign-middle elementor-widget elementor-widget-author-box\" data-id=\"00489c0\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"author-box.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-author-box\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div  class=\"elementor-author-box__avatar\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"https://dduconnect.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/default-user-300x300.png\" alt=\"Kaushal Parmar\">\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-author-box__text\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div >\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3 class=\"elementor-author-box__name\">Kaushal Parmar</h3>\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-author-box__bio\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>DESIGNER<br />\nIC 6th Sem</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-caed8a3 elementor-widget__width-auto elementor-hidden-desktop elementor-hidden-tablet elementor-widget elementor-widget-spacer\" data-id=\"caed8a3\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"spacer.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-spacer\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-spacer-inner\"></div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t</section>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t",

She drops on the couch; angry, frustrated. The code that she\u2019s been working on for days now isn\u2019t giving any results. Feeling even more ruthless than the program not running could make her feel, because of the news she caught up on the tele in the neighboring shop on her way back home.<\/p>\n<p>Valencia Apple store robbed at gunpoint.<\/p>\n<p>Temperatures rise, schools closed. Reports say global warming could be the reason.<\/p>\n<p>Three women sexually abused at a psych hospital.<\/p>\n<p>Another murder in three days, Investigation reveals political scam.<\/p><p>Satiated with the world, the chaos in the lives of people; suffering from anxiety, depression, the political dogma, the irreversible change that has been made on this globe, she gives up any hope for betterment. In a flicker of a moment, an idea flashes through her bewildered mind. She runs across the lobby and into her room, swings the door close, takes out her laptop and begins writing some code. \u201cI will free this world of all wrongdoings. Evil will suffer.\u201d , she mutters as her fingers run over the keyboard hastily. \u201cI will create a virtual reality!\u201d , she smiles wickedly.\u201d Who knew her purest of intentions as that of Enki in the Atrahasis were soon going to be turned into that of the Enlil\u2019s. Just when all the systems were ready to go, she hears a bamming noise. In a jerk she presses something. In a split second, or at the least that\u2019s what it felt like, she found herself in place that looked exactly like her room but distinguishable with the vibrant, colorful, warmer environment. She knew she was in the virtual world. She could still hear the noise that seemed to come from the adjacent room, she could make out from the faint lyrics that it was the \u2018De M`usica Ligera\u2019. Instead of jumping straight into doing what she had come here for, she thought fit to explore the street madness of the virtual world. She felt pride in herself as she couldn\u2019t believe the world she was in at the moment was created by her.\u201d<\/p><p>\u201cOkay, common Robin, tell me, what you would have been thinking if you were in Ver`onica\u2019s place?\u201d I asked. Those notorious eyes wanted to say a lot. \u201cI would want to leave everything and be there forever.\u201d , her eyes sparkling with delight. \u201cWhat about your mission?\u201d. She sighed, \u201cPerhaps, it\u2019s not my job to decide who gets to live or who deserves to die. I would be content with the happiness of being able to create a virtual world of my own.\u201d \u201cCertainly\u201d, I smiled. \u201cI wish even Ver`onica could think like you.\u201d Story continues. \u201cLater in the night, Ver`onica decides to get back to her mission. She inputs as many names as she could remember; those who she didn\u2019t want to exist. With fright, yet abhorrence for people, clutching her panda in one hand, she compiles the code with the other. She goes out in the front porch of her house to witness her neighbor, Mrs. Didier disappear. Mrs. Didier was a trouble-maker. She would keep nudging her about her grades. Strangely though, she saw the vendor by the streetlight vanishing, first, followed by the stout, old man walking by the street. Soon everybody was vanishing. She ran towards her laptop, panting. She realised her mistake. It was the same part of code she had written that she wasn\u2019t able to debug for days. The code entered a loop and wouldn\u2019t end and wouldn\u2019t even accept names of the people. Her legs weakened. She felt her body shrink, she wanted to go crazy. All forms of guilt, frustration, failure, self-loathe changed colors on her face. She couldn\u2019t have been more devastated. Pulling herself together, she decided to go back to the reality. She really was going crazy; she was cursing herself for what she had done. She did not just destroy the virtual world but joined the real with the virtual. Whatever happened there now happened here. People disappearing everywhere, her friends, her family, everything. She lost everyone. She cursed herself even more, as the fate now turned to her. It now occurred to her that she had been the bad guy all along, that it is not her job to do the justice. She doesn\u2019t get to decide who lives, who dies. In no time, the world became some sort of a place as if it had undergone a format. Spellbound was she stranded in a bare field of yellow grass; bare of humans. The scenery that she had only read about in books, how the earth might have looked centuries ago. Disrupted at the same time, by the feeling of loneliness, accompanied only by the computer in her room, still running the programs. Feeling the warmth by the touch of the grass, she vanished. \u201cWhat?!!\u201d, Robin sprung up. \u201cWhy does it have to end in a tragedy?\u201d. \u201cThat\u2019s what it is. One cannot outrun karma. As the saying goes, \u2018what goes around, comes around.\u2019\u201d \u201cWait. What about the computer?\u201d she asked furiously. \u201cLet\u2019s discuss the computer the next time you have such a mental outbreak. The computer will ignite the beginning of a whole new story.\u201d, I shrugged.<\/p><\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/section>\n\t\t\t\t<section

I have led a good life. Not mediocre, thankfully. Ninety years and Raege Pattis a brand. I can\u2019t say I\u2019m content, and I\u2019m grateful Idon\u2019t have to. As they take the life support off and my family members watch in silent grief, Iprepare myself for the deep slumber. Turns out, there was no way to prepare me.<\/p><p>2nd Life : I am born as Kaumm Sterling. I grow up in a poor family that serves the Patts\u2019. I am 14 as Raege Patt is born. His grandfather is amused as he watches my adoration of the new kid. I think about how precious life is, and how this newborn is even more precious. I am more than eager to take him into my arms. I feel a strange connection, but it may just be another fictional madness in my head.<\/p><p>A few years later, as he grows up, I try to surround myself with him and try to teach him whatever I learned, but he\u2019s well, too headstrong and maybe a little bit classist so to say. He dismisses my approaches and finds something better to do. I try not to be disappointed. His grandfather offers consolation, and I take it. As I lie on my deathbed 30 years from Raege\u2019s birth, I realize in my last moments of consciousness that I have been him, and for some reason unknown, I was born as his acquaintance again. This craziness in my last moments cannot be voiced, and I find myself spiraling down before I can think of a way out.<\/p><p>3rd Life : Iam born as Vincent Patt, Raege\u2019s younger, mentally challenged brother. All I receive from my brother and almost everyone else is just sympathy, never a touch of empathy or attempts of relating and understanding. I live in my illness for most of my life. Psychotic episodes and hallucinations nobody can quite explain.<\/p><p>I look for relief in our domestic help\u2019s eyes. I wish he gave me the same care he gave my brother. But obviously, who would care about the broken piece&#8230; I wallow in self-pity as I die in one of my psychotic episodes at a tender age of 18, as I think my older brother and Kaumm have been my past lives.<\/p><p>4th Life : I am born as Trud Patt, and I am a factory worker. For some reason, I have a tendency to never underestimate or be unkind to someone\u2019s efforts. Something tells me that I have already suffered from it.\u00a0<\/p><p>I live in mediocrity for most of my life, but I am content. This balance makes perfect sense to me. I try to be appreciative and value people more than money, and it does pay off. I create a financially and socially secure environment for my children and it\u2019s more than I could ask for. I try to support my specially-abled child Vincent but he is looking for something else, and I don\u2019t want to pressurize him with my presence as well.\u00a0<\/p><p>As I lay on my deathbed, Raege is there by my side. Vincent has passed away. I take one lastlook in his eyes, and I sense myself there. I am him. I realize this as I am slipping away, and I am barely able to utter the words \u201cBe Kind\u201d. I know they won\u2019t stay with him. But I did what I had to. I am content and ready for the next phase of life and death&#8230;\u00a0<\/p><\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/section>\n\t\t\t\t<section

Then he suddenly whispered, \u201cIt\u2019s July 25th today a few weeks left for my birthday. A whole year has passed. It\u2019s been a year since I lost you my dearest Anita, a year since I shifted here with our son John, a year since I left the country where I grew up, a year since I have started talking to myself the whole day. Of course, your son does take care of me, he takes time out to talk to me. But he too has a family to look after. But the striking resemblance of our grandson Rohan does remind me of you daily. Here I have every material possession a man my age could ask for but as you already know not all desires are earthly. I often pass my time looking at my childhood picture frames. But it\u2019s more fun talking to you. Seems like I have bored you enough. I will go back to tending to my flowers. \u201d<\/p>\n<p>That night his grandson looked at his frames and inquired,\u201dGrandpa who is this man? He is present in almost every photo of your school and college&#8217;s picture frames.\u201d To which Rakesh smilingly answered, \u201cSon, he is your Grandpa\u2019s best friend and so &#8211; called partner in crime. We were together from the beginning of the school till the end of our college life. And ironically his name was also Rakesh Gupta.\u201d \u201cYou can\u2019t be serious, both of you shared the same name,\u201d John exclaimed with a burst of laughter. \u201cYes, in fact, we were a duo. We were always together in our school and college days. In fact, during our college days, a girl who liked Rakesh mistook my bag for his and placed a love letter in it. In the letter, she asked him to meet her at the caf\u00e9. So I went there counting my lucky stars. Isat on the table she was sitting on. We stared awkwardly like owls at each other for a good ten minutes until she finally realized the blunder she had made and broke the silence. And I can\u2019t count the number of times I have gone to the Principal\u2019s office listening to his share of scolding.\u201d He said smiling sheepishly. \u201cWell, those days have long gone in the past. Now I can only rewind those days with the support of these pictures.\u201d John who was eavesdropping the entire conversation murmured to himself, \u201cI achieved everything a man could ask for yet I find myself incapable of providing my father with the happiness he truly deserves. Have I failed as a son?\u201d He sighed. Saying those words he retired to his room with guilt buried deep in his heart.<\/p>\n<p>A few weeks later, Rakesh received an unexpected courier from India. At first, he was sceptical as to who could have sent it to him. But then without giving it much thought he decided to open it and found a letter on the top of the gift &#8211; wrapped courier. He opened the letter only to find the name of his friend Rakesh B. Gupta on the top of the letter. He was shocked and stared at the letter with a complete blank drawn on his face but then he decided to call his son but his phone appeared to be busy. So without giving it a great deal of thought, he decided to deliver the parcel to the correct address all by himself carrying a small ray of hope in his heart. His mind was filled with all sorts of questions and brimming with an uncontained outburst of excitement. So he rushed to the recipient\u2019s address without a second of thought and rang the bell to his door.<\/p>\n<p>His mind was a blank slate, his heart was racing, he didn\u2019t know what to expect. To his surprise, he found his son on the front door with a joyous and expectant smile on his face. Before he could catch a breath and recollect himself he saw an old man with a welcoming smile he remembered for years. \u201cSeems like your hair count finally matches your IQ count.\u201d He chuckled. The face was different but the smile and the remark brought tears to his eyes as he said, \u201cRakesh, it\u2019s truly you. I can\u2019t believe my eyes.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s your birthday gift dad. I know I am slightly early this time. But hey who doesn\u2019t like advance presents.\u201d said John. \u201cBless my lucky stars. I was sitting at the same caf\u00e9 your old friend visited. And considering the number times, I have heard the tales of your endeavours it didn\u2019t take me much time to recognize him.\u201d He added. \u201cYou never opened the present did you Dad. Since now you know that it\u2019s officially yours feel free to open it.\u201d On unwrapping, he found another photo frame with an inscription, \u2018To the craziness of the past and the smiles of the future.\u2019 With a teary smile, Rakesh replied, \u201cThank you so much, son. I couldn\u2019t have asked for a better present or a better son.&#8221;<\/p><\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/section>\n\t\t\t\t<section class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-f9c2d27 elementor-section-boxed elementor-section-height-default elementor-section-height-default elementor-section elementor-top-section\" data-id=\"f9c2d27\" data-element_type=\"section\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-container elementor-column-gap-default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-row\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"aux-parallax-section elementor-element elementor-element-9bbc2e1 elementor-column elementor-col-100 elementor-top-column\" data-id=\"9bbc2e1\" data-element_type=\"column\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-column-wrap  elementor-element-populated\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-wrap\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-8ac731d elementor-author-box--layout-image-left elementor-author-box--align-left elementor-widget elementor-widget-author-box\" data-id=\"8ac731d\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"author-box.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-author-box\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div  class=\"elementor-author-box__avatar\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"https:\/\/dduconnect.in\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/12\/icon-login-3.jpg-300x300.png\" alt=\"Mufaddal J.

Adityan, holding a coconut stepped into the temple. Inside, everything was yellow coloured and everything smelled of recent rain. He went straight to the kuthambalam were his favourite play Kathakali was being performed.<br \/><\/strong><strong><br \/>It didn\u2019t matter to him that the Kathakali had begun hours before he came. For him, they were as familiar as the house he lived in. The plays didn\u2019t surprise him with the unforeseen. Adityan sat there with his back against a white pillar. On the stage he watched a man playing the role of Karna, the great and generous warrior. Adityan thought to himself \u2018Karna\u2019s oath\u2019 and smiled at his own intelligence of remembering the name of the part being performed from his childhood. Karna, the desolate son of Sun, the abandoned child was praying near the banks of the Ganga. It was the scene just before the great Mahabharata yudh(war).<br \/><\/strong><strong><br \/>Then the red-eyed Kunti appeared. The role of Kunti was too performed by a man but with ample bosoms. She had come to tell Karna a story. She told him about a young beautiful woman who had been gifted a boon. A mantra, that she could choose a lover from the gods. To test if it really worked, she went to an empty field in the morning. Closing both the eyes and facing the clear blue sky, she recited the mantra. When she opened her eyes, she saw the Lord Sun, the god of the day himself appeared before her. Charmed by the beauty of shimmering God, she gave herself to him. Nine months later, she had a son. Kunti said the young woman loved her son more than anything that existed for her but her fate had other plans. She couldn\u2019t keep him as she was unmarried. So she put him in a basket and cast him away in a river.<br \/><\/strong><strong><br \/>The child was then found by a charioteer who named him Karna. Karna who listened the whole story cautiously, asked Kunti with tears in his eyes, \u201cWho was she? Take me to her. I want to meet my mother.\u201d An ashamed Kunti bowed down to him and said, \u201cshe\u2019s standing just before you.\u201d Karna\u2019s emotion was heightened. He was both angry and delighted to find his original mother after decades. He asked her, \u201cwhere were you all this time? Did you ever hold me? Did you ever feed me? Did you ever think of me? Did you ever look for me? Did you ever wonder where I might be?\u201d<br \/><\/strong><strong><br \/>Adityan who was still sitting under the white pillar was familiar with these questions. Not because kathakali was saved to his memory but because his life greatly depended on these questions. He lived each day by asking these questions to himself. Adityan, the generous kiddo just like Karna grew up without his mother in an orphanage. But the only difference was that Adityan knew who his mother was from his childhood. Adityan knew that he was an illegitimate son. He knew his mother too couldn\u2019t keep him because she was unmarried when she had him. He knew that his mother was then married. He knew she had other children. Two Sons. More beloved sons- Adityan always believed.<br \/><\/strong><strong><br \/>On the stage Kunti wailed to her son to make a promise. She wanted him to abandon the Mahabharata yudh as he would be fighting his own blood. His younger brothers. The Pandavas. More beloved sons. Karna couldn\u2019t make this promise as he would have to revoke another one made to Duryodhana. Karna always hated Arjuna, the eldest among Pandavas but not the eldest among Kunti\u2019s sons. He was the one who publicly criticized him for being a low charioteer\u2019s son. He hated Arjuna. But on the other hand, he could not refuse his mother. So he made an adjustment. He said, \u201cYudhistira I won\u2019t harm, Bhima I won\u2019t kill, Nakula and Sahadeva I won\u2019t touch. But Arjuna I won\u2019t spare.\u201d<br \/><\/strong><strong><br \/>Adityan put his head between his two folded knees and sat there. He remembered how his mother used to ignore him in public but would shower all her love when she came to orphanage to Please stop doingvisit him. He remembered her beautiful smile. The most beautiful smile he thought. But Adityan never talked to her. Not a single time. Because he always hated her for making him live a lone life. One without anyone to look after.<br \/><\/strong><strong><br \/>Adityan remembered the last time she came to visit. She had said, \u201cAdi, you are a smart young boy. Always remember I love you in same way I love your younger brothers. Please talk to me for once.\u201d Just like every other time, Adityan ignored her. And then days later he came to know he would never be able to talk to her or for that matter never see her. A car accident made all the difference.<\/strong><\/p><\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/section>\n\t\t\t\t<section class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-406faab elementor-section-boxed elementor-section-height-default elementor-section-height-default elementor-section elementor-top-section\" data-id=\"406faab\" data-element_type=\"section\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-container elementor-column-gap-default\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"aux-parallax-section elementor-element elementor-element-d33c16e elementor-column elementor-col-100 elementor-top-column\" data-id=\"d33c16e\" data-element_type=\"column\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-wrap elementor-element-populated\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-2ac67dc elementor-author-box--layout-image-left elementor-author-box--align-left elementor-widget elementor-widget-author-box\" data-id=\"2ac67dc\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"author-box.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-author-box\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div  class=\"elementor-author-box__avatar\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"https:\/\/dduconnect.in\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/SRUTHI-300x300.jpg\" alt=\"Sruthi Cheruvullil\">\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-author-box__text\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div >\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3 class=\"elementor-author-box__name\">Sruthi Cheruvullil<\/h3>\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-author-box__bio\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>EC 5th SEM<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/section>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t",

The day had kicked off with a heated argument with my girlfriend. It wouldn&#8217;t have got worse until when my director fired me from the most-promising project of my company.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; margin: 0cm 0cm 10.0pt 0cm;\">To catch home early, I chose the shortcut to Gandhi Marg, which paved its way through a dreary street. After driving for a mile, unexpectedly a young man, standing by the road waved his hand for a lift. He stood beside his luxurious car, looking out for help. I wished to avoid him but I was pleased by his wince. Knocking at my window pane he said, &#8220;Sir, would you please drop me to our apartment? I know, we are neighbours. My car broke down and I have been waiting here for an hour.&#8221; I couldn&#8217;t recall him as my neighbour, but I couldn&#8217;t turn him down.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; margin: 0cm 0cm 10.0pt 0cm;\">In no time, he got into my car and we drove off.\u00a0 He was zealous like a college boy, with a bright smile on his face.\u00a0 To strike up a conversation, I asked his name. \u201cSiddharth\u201d, he replied with a smile. \u201cWhat! Are you serious? That used to be my pen name under which my articles were published in my University Tabloid&#8221;, I almost shouted. &#8220;Sir, it took no time for me to know that you are a DDUian. I have read your poems. In fact, Sir I was your super junior at DDU Connect&#8221;, he replied. Before I could ask him about his batch, my mobile phone interrupted our conversation. It was my Dad. Declining the call, I said, \u201cActually I don\u2019t trust-\u201d; but he cut me short, \u201cSir, before you instil your trust in me, I would suggest you talk to your dad. It could be something important\u201d. \u201cNothing important\u201d, I continued, \u201che may just want to know if I am on my way home, or not\u201d. \u201cJust call him up\u201d, he said. Parking the car by the roadside, I called my dad. To my surprise, my dad wanted my account details for an important transaction.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; margin: 0cm 0cm 10.0pt 0cm;\">After messaging the details, we proceeded to our destination. The invincible wall of an individual with this stranger took no time to disappear. From his conversation, he appeared to be a man who was not under any stress and looked carefree of any commitments in life. I asked, \u201cSo, are you an engineer?\u201d\u00a0 \u201cI am a writer\u201d, he said curtly.\u00a0 His replies to my queries by now had left me in shock. \u201cThen how do you maintain your lifestyle?\u201d I asked with a smile. He smiled back. I said, \u201cBrother, for a stable life one needs a occupation. However, it drains away your energy and robs all the carefree pleasures of life, and, those adventures of youth too\u201d. \u201cSir, wasn&#8217;t it your own choice to enjoy the life of an engineer? As we grow up, we complicate the simple aspects of our life. In the wee hours as the weather chills, you close the windows to keep the cold outside whereas a ship caught in the storm, ties up its sails high to transcend new shores of opportunities&#8221;, he said.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; margin: 0cm 0cm 10.0pt 0cm;\">While I was parking my car, I offered him to be my guest. We got into the lift. Thankfully, our watchman had held it open for us.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; margin: 0cm 0cm 10.0pt 0cm;\">Sitting on the sofa, we got into a discussion on the problems faced by a common man in life over a glass of wine. When I told him about the argument with my girlfriend, he asked for my mobile. I was hesitant but couldn&#8217;t turn him down. Rather than a text message, he sent a flash message to her. I was set aback by his gesture, but I pretended not to rebel at the moment. To my surprise, I got an instant reply which read: &#8216;Dear, I love you and I&#8217;m always there for you. Have a good night.&#8217; For a moment, I felt that his presence was a healing gel over my wounds. He quoted an episode from his novel &#8216;Stay by Me&#8217;. For a moment, I felt like I had read it somewhere but I couldn&#8217;t recall as each sip of wine was weighing upon me. I did not know when I passed out.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; margin: 0cm 0cm 10.0pt 0cm;\">Next morning, the galling ring of the doorbell woke me up. I was amazed to find myself on my bed and wondered how I bid farewell to the stranger. As I opened the door, I found the watchman with a pile of bills. To know about the stranger, I asked, \u201cHey, do you know on which floor that man lives; one who was with me last night?\u201d \u201cYou were all alone Sahib\u201d, he replied timidly. Then he turned around to ask, \u201cAre you alright, Sahib?\u201d I just nodded my head. Closing the door, I rushed to my laptop and checked the CCTV footage of the camera at my doorstep. He was right, I was all alone at my door last night. But, there were two empty glasses on the tea-poi standing erect, looking up to the ceiling.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; margin: 0cm 0cm 10.0pt 0cm;\">I was baffled; incapacitated to distinguish between my reverie and the reality.\u00a0 Later, while surfing through my laptop, I found a folder named &#8216;Stay by Me&#8217;, a compilation of files containing the chapters of the first novel I authored but, I never published it.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; margin: 0cm 0cm 10.0pt 0cm;\">Today, at the age of 72, while breathing my last, I, Siddharth Gautam, the best-selling author of the generation, while assimilating the moments of that memorable date, asked my wife (and my then girl-friend) about the flash message that appeared on her phone that evening. She utters the three-beautiful words:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; margin: 0cm 0cm 10.0pt 0cm;\">&#8220;STAY BY ME&#8221;.<\/p><\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/section>\n\t\t\t\t<section class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-4b91454 elementor-section-boxed elementor-section-height-default elementor-section-height-default elementor-section elementor-top-section\" data-id=\"4b91454\" data-element_type=\"section\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-container elementor-column-gap-default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-row\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"aux-parallax-section elementor-element elementor-element-69d2c37 elementor-column elementor-col-100 elementor-top-column\" data-id=\"69d2c37\" data-element_type=\"column\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-column-wrap  elementor-element-populated\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-wrap\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-a1c28fb elementor-author-box--layout-image-left elementor-author-box--align-left elementor-widget elementor-widget-author-box\" data-id=\"a1c28fb\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"author-box.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-author-box\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div  class=\"elementor-author-box__avatar\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"https:\/\/dduconnect.in\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/11\/NIRMAL-300x300.jpeg\" alt=\"Nirmal Sunil\">\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-author-box__text\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div >\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3 class=\"elementor-author-box__name\">Nirmal Sunil<\/h3>\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-author-box__bio\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>MH 6th SEM<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/section>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t",

Last year, I was in New York working with the FBI investigating the cases of violence taking a toll over women and children. I was off-duty on one of the Wednesday, 23rd of June. According to the legend, all the descendants of the arctic club have to meet annually to discuss their insecurities and carry forward the tradition for it will strengthen the ultimate bond of friendship. All our family members obeyed it. It was a game nonetheless, of our soi-disant insecurities; only to be laughed at. So my friends- Apollo and Harper, and I were supposed to meet in Philadelphia. The tradition went ignored in the two years past the last year because of our jobs. On the given day, I was driving in my car. It was just as one would wish a road trip to be. Loud metal rock blared out through the partially open windows. In the back of my mind, I was revisiting the old memories of our meetings in all these years. I remembered subconsciously that one of Apollo&#8217;s insecurities, when he was in mid-school was &#8216;pineapple on pizza&#8217;. He thought he was disgusted by the mere thought of it and could taste neither in their true form. I found myself giggling over such ostentatious ideas before my eyes caught hold of the sight of a man. I pulled over to the left side, where he was standing holding a briefcase, to take a better glance at him.</p><p><br />I peeked through the window. The man, he appeared to be in his 60s; detailed lines traced his forehead, eyes that propagated anxiety sat in loose orbs of skin and a trimmed beard that spanned from one earlobe to the other. He said he was grateful that I stopped to his side but he was also greatly distressed and wanted a ride. Something about him compelled me to offer him a ride. He sat on the front seat and we drove off. He said his daughter who is a journalist is being held captive by a group of Iraqi men and that he has to stop them before they do anything to her. We didn&#8217;t talk the whole time. He led me to a place in the nook of the city, which was nowhere near to my destination. I told him that I am an agent and that I could help rescue his daughter. He agreed and stepped out of the car. The place looked exactly like one, where one would expect the abduction to have taken place. I stepped out of the car only to find a small hut white-washed out-and-out. I turned around to ask him how he had known about this place only to find that he had vanished. I walked straight into the hut. Except for the entry door, there was no other way out. Searching for some cue I discovered a trapdoor which when opened led underground through a staircase. I descended the stairs. There was sheer darkness and I had to feel the stairs with my toes to step further. I couldn&#8217;t judge where I was going or whence I came. After a moderate scuffle, the stairs stopped and stretched into a wide floor. My right foot stumbled onto something hard; I drew out a gun adroit and stood in the &#8216;hasty sling&#8217; position pointing at the floor. I poked at it with my foot and realized that it was an immobile thing; wishing I had my phone with myself to turn on the flashlight. Suddenly the room lit up. I figured it was a jacket and thought it could help prevent attacks, so I swiftly put it on. A voice broke the stillness. It was the man; his voice, husky yet monotonous. He spoke creepily this time though. Laughing scornfully as he spoke, &#8220;Welcome.. my seven wonders. You have all entered the deadliest of my labyrinths. There is only one way out. Find it and you escape safe or..&#8221; pausing to laugh mockingly. He continued, &#8220;kill each one of you and I let you go. The jacket that you all are wearing has got nails on the insides that penetrate deeper into your body every hour that goes by. You have 24 hours.” and his voice faded. I was in the insecurity room, this time though, a real one! I ran straight ahead. The more I ran, the more I was lost. I couldn&#8217;t figure out why this was happening to me. An hour had passed by, I looked in my watch. I felt the jacket tighten. I could feel something pinching my abdomen. I burst into tears and suddenly I heard a gunshot. It dawned on me that I was going to die. Maybe that was the only way; I started running along the paths that could perhaps lead me to someone, but everything was in vain. With every passing hour, the jacket pierced into my body. By the 7th hour, blood began spurting out of my body like a fountain. I had lost all hope. I heard gunshots in the background. 10 hours passed by and blood kept rushing out of my body. I fell unconscious. My partially open eyes suddenly saw someone standing in front of me. It was a girl. She wasn&#8217;t wearing any jacket, how lucky she was, thought I. &#8220;Wait! She is a kid.&#8221; I exclaimed in shock. &#8220;I should save her&#8221;, thought my agent mind. On the other hand, human instinct was saying something else. My trembling hand reached out for the gun. I shot her. The walls rose open, the jacket ceased to contract.</p></div>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t</section>\n\t\t\t\t<section class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-c4a3b94 elementor-section-boxed elementor-section-height-default elementor-section-height-default elementor-section elementor-top-section\" data-id=\"c4a3b94\" data-element_type=\"section\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-container elementor-column-gap-default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-row\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"aux-parallax-section elementor-element elementor-element-14e3287 elementor-column elementor-col-100 elementor-top-column\" data-id=\"14e3287\" data-element_type=\"column\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-column-wrap  elementor-element-populated\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-wrap\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-5791be0 elementor-author-box--layout-image-left elementor-author-box--align-left elementor-widget elementor-widget-author-box\" data-id=\"5791be0\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"author-box.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-author-box\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div  class=\"elementor-author-box__avatar\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"https://dduconnect.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/SNIGDHA-300x300.jpg\" alt=\"Snigdha Lokre\">\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-author-box__text\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div >\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3 class=\"elementor-author-box__name\">Snigdha Lokre</h3>\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-author-box__bio\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>EC 4th SEM </p>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t</section>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t",

One could hear the clanking noise of the windows of a room on the topmost floor of a skyscraper even on the roads of a market full of bustle. I was sitting in one of the rooms on 7th floor on one of the two single sitting sofas made of pure leather through which ran long cracks erupting with stories of sufferers of all ages. In front of me sat Mrs Ava, my psychotherapist, in a plain room with white-washed walls on a rocking chair that made long periodical creaks to the rhythm of which I recounted to her the ordeals of my recent nightmare. \u201cI have a strong feeling Ava, the dream meant something. You need to tell me what it could lead to. I have thought about it almost a thousand times; the death camps, piles of dead people, gas chambers, people in the military uniform&#8230;\u201d, I said scratching my head desperately. \u201cArgh, I can\u2019t seem to find the link!\u201d, I grunted. Well, Ava knew exactly what the dream meant. She had known the suffering I had gone through but she didn\u2019t want it to happen to me again. \u201cIt\u2019s alright Nial, I suggest you do not stress your brain so much. It\u2019s just a dream.\u201d, she comforted. She understood that it was easier to treat patients who were conscious of their memories than it was to treat those who had lost them.\u00a0<\/p><p>The following day when I was walking my way back to Ava\u2019s therapy class, a piece of paper came floating by and landed on the road and I stepped on it subconsciously. I stepped back and bent to pick up the paper and looked at it. It seemed like a torn piece of a document that perhaps contained names of some people. It looked like it was torn from the middle-top portion of the document which read, \u2018The Schindler\u2019s List\u2019. \u201cSchindler!\u201d, I gasped. \u201cThe name, I have heard it before.\u201d, I recited in the back of my mind. Memories flashed. I was taken aback. They were similar to the ones I had seen in my dreams. Terrified, I went and sat on the bench to my right under an oak tree and began contemplating over the possibility of the link between this mere piece of paper and the dream of the previous night. In an attempt to analyse the faded letters, I found an address and a telephone number, \u201c182, Cross Street\u201d and \u201c7398\u201d. Thinking that it belonged to some play called \u2018The Schindler\u2019s List\u2019, I thought I could probably find the link between the various elements of my dream. I stood up and went straight into the telephone booth and dialled \u20187&#8211;3&#8211;9&#8211;8&#8242; on the swiss rotary telephone and waited. \u201cHello?..\u201d, I spoke trembling. \u201cThey are coming for you.\u201d, a voice from the other side cut me short. \u201cWhat?\u201d, I replied. The phone got disconnected. I shrunk and looked around in horror. Unknown, unvisited memories kept flashing back and forth through my mind. I didn\u2019t know what was happening. I began to sweat, hard. I stumbled on the sidewall of the booth. The phrase of the call receiver, it reverberated in my mind; growing in magnitude. It was straining my mind. It drained out all my energy and I let out a deep growl. Ah, there it was! \u201cOskar Schindler. The man who saved me and hundreds of others from the inhumane tortures of the Nazis. He had made the Schindler\u2019s list. It had carried my family\u2019s name and mine too.\u201d, I realised. I slammed the door open and without a thought ran like a sheep; terrified. It was there; all the torture, as if it happened yesterday. I could recall people being killed in gas chambers and being taken to death camps. I didn\u2019t know where I was going, but I ran to save my family- my parents and my siblings. \u201cHe said, they were coming. They are going to kill us. I am going to have to save mom, dad and Anna, Joseph and Hans.\u201d, I kept saying to myself on loop. I ran like a coward. I remember that day, the one when they came searching for my family. My mom, whispering from afar, where she and others hid, indicating to me to stay hidden behind the wide pole while they searched in our homes.<\/p><p>I took the first train to Auschwitz. I don\u2019t remember if I have ever visited the place after the tragedy and I didn\u2019t want to go back. But there was no choice. I somehow reached the place where the mass genocide had taken place. Upon reaching, my eyes couldn\u2019t behold what they saw. A massive base of the German military. It was being restored and so was the evil. Turning my face to the south-east, I could see a small ghetto with piles of dead bodies. There lay my family. Not my mom, dad and siblings. But my wife and children. \u201cI just cannot take it anymore. I have lost all my family.\u201d, I dropped down and cried to myself. The next thing I knew, my body unfolded and straightened and I was running towards the armed guards. An official noticed me running and yelled, \u201cShoot!\u201d Before any of the military men came in their senses, I snatched a rifle from the guard from behind his back, placed its mouth on my stomach and pulled the trigger. All memories came flashing by as if it all happened yesterday.<\/p><\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/section>\n\t\t\t\t<section class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-d01141c elementor-section-boxed elementor-section-height-default elementor-section-height-default elementor-section elementor-top-section\" data-id=\"d01141c\" data-element_type=\"section\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-container elementor-column-gap-default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-row\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"aux-parallax-section elementor-element elementor-element-57ea957 elementor-column elementor-col-100 elementor-top-column\" data-id=\"57ea957\" data-element_type=\"column\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-column-wrap  elementor-element-populated\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-wrap\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-a0334ad elementor-author-box--layout-image-left elementor-author-box--align-left elementor-widget elementor-widget-author-box\" data-id=\"a0334ad\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"author-box.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-author-box\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div  class=\"elementor-author-box__avatar\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"https:\/\/dduconnect.in\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/SNIGDHA-300x300.jpg\" alt=\"Snigdha Lokre\">\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-author-box__text\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div >\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3 class=\"elementor-author-box__name\">Snigdha Lokre<\/h3>\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-author-box__bio\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>EC 4th SEM <\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/section>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t",

I gulped down the sputum down my throat, tried to get up and figure out where I was. People were looking at me. Those eyes were aberrant to me, yet customary for them.<\/p><p>&#8220;Here. Take my hand.&#8221; a slightly older man offered his hand to me. &#8220;I don&#8217;t remember anything.&#8221; was the first thing I said and he smiled. At first he seemed sly to me, but as it turned out, he was quite a generous old man. He also explained to me the meaning of this place and the meaning of us all being here. Apparently, this was a place where people were sent after they die. However, it wasn&#8217;t heaven or hell, it was a place for souls with questions. People knew they&#8217;re dead but don&#8217;t remember what caused it. But, do I have any questions?<\/p><p>Jos\u00e9, as he said his name was, guided me through the place and also briefed me about all the people who greeted me. They were nice to me except for one woman. I sure didn&#8217;t know who she was and I thought she doesn&#8217;t either, but she looked at me with ire and left. I asked Jos\u00e9 what was wrong with her, to which he answered &#8220;She&#8217;s the odd one&#8221; referring to her mental condition. Maybe I&#8217;ll talk to her someday. I told myself.<\/p><p>Five days had passed and I still didn&#8217;t remember my name. Why? I muttered to myself while walking towards a group of people. The place wasn&#8217;t so bad. It was huge and every evening we had this gathering where everyone shared whatever they wanted to. &#8220;Girl!&#8221; exclaimed one of the old men. &#8220;Did you recall your name yet?&#8221; he asked with amusement. Flustered, I tucked a lock of hair behind my ear and shook my head. &#8220;Mm-Maya&#8221; said someone from the crowd. People made a way to disclose the person who spoke. It was Amy, the odd one. &#8220;What?&#8221; I asked curiously. &#8220;Mm-Maya heh-h&#8221; she repeated. Everyone looked at her intrigued. But Amy ravingly, just left the place. Everyone thought this was just an Amy-incident but I didn&#8217;t feel so. She had been acting weird with me since the day she saw me I don&#8217;t know why. I followed her and called out her name. She wouldn&#8217;t stop until I grabbed ahold of her.<\/p><p>&#8220;Amy do you know my name?&#8221; I asked. &#8220;Maya&#8221; she laughed. &#8220;What do you know about me?&#8221; She didn&#8217;t answer and continued laughing. &#8220;Tell me!&#8221; I asked demandingly. &#8220;You killed me!&#8221; she shouted with amusement and started to leave the spot.<\/p><p>&#8220;What are you talking about? How do you know that?&#8221; I demanded for an answer. &#8220;You came to my place and suffocated me with a carry bag hehe&#8221; she answered. She acted as if all this was a joke. &#8220;You&#8217;re mad and I&#8217;m going.&#8221; I started walking towards the opposite direction. &#8220;You had been taking pills before killing me to forget what happened. L-look at your sk-skin, isn&#8217;t it pale?&#8221; she told me. I paused and orderly looked at my hands. They were pale. But maybe she was just bluffing. Why would I take beta blockers before actually killing her? Wouldn&#8217;t it be logical that I took them after I committed the crime? And for all the sake, how did she even know me? Yes, she&#8217;s just bluffing. I fastened away from her.<\/p><p>&#8220;D-don&#8217;t you want to know who killed your baby?&#8221;<\/p><p>Startled, I looked at her. She paused for a brief moment and shouted &#8220;I did!&#8221; A tear left my eye. I had a baby? Suddenly everything inside me felt callous. &#8220;What did you do? Tell me what you did. Please!&#8221; I cried. I wanted to annihilate the woman&#8217;s existence. She just looked at me with a bulwark on, while tears rolled down me cheeks until I became physically unable to maintain my posture.<\/p><p>&#8220;I ran my c-car over your boy because I didn&#8217;t l-like him being with you.&#8221; she said blatantly. &#8220;You knew I did it but people won&#8217;t listen. You turned into a fleabag and started taking pills to forget. Monday night you came to m-my place and started a c- about your boy&#8217;s death. Then you killed me.&#8221; She blankly stated all of this as if nothing mattered.<\/p><p>&#8220;Why don&#8217;t I remember my past then? Like all the other people here?&#8221; I asked. &#8220;Don&#8217;t you get it? You continued taking pills. It makes you forget things! You probably had no memory when you died.&#8221; I tried to put the pieces together. Everything made sense now. &#8220;He didn&#8217;t deserve to live. Like my boy Sage. No boy deserves to live. Like my boy Sage.&#8221; She chanted these line again and again. I felt, empty.<\/p><p>&#8220;He is here you know? Your boy.&#8221; I gazed at her with my now crimson eyes waiting for her to say more. &#8220;And I really really like it that he doesn&#8217;t remember you yet. That I recognize him everyday and you can&#8217;t. It really pleases me.&#8221; &#8220;Please tell me where he is.&#8221; I cried. &#8220;What is it worth? Lincoln won&#8217;t even recognize you!&#8221; she stated.<\/p><p>&#8220;Lincoln..&#8221; I huffed. A sudden gush of elation ran through me. &#8220;Lincoln! Lincoln!&#8221; I shouted. I looked at every boy&#8217;s face, tried to recall anything at all. &#8220;Lincoln!&#8221; I didn&#8217;t stop. He was here. I felt like what the tides would feel when the full moon accompanied. I have to find him. &#8220;Lincoln!&#8221;<\/p><p>&#8220;M-mom?&#8221; A sweet voice followed my calling. It was an odd one.<\/p><\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/section>\n\t\t\t\t<section class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-0a8bd0a elementor-section-boxed elementor-section-height-default elementor-section-height-default elementor-section elementor-top-section\" data-id=\"0a8bd0a\" data-element_type=\"section\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-container elementor-column-gap-default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-row\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"aux-parallax-section elementor-element elementor-element-44e7c7e elementor-column elementor-col-100 elementor-top-column\" data-id=\"44e7c7e\" data-element_type=\"column\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-column-wrap  elementor-element-populated\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-wrap\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-6c583e2 elementor-author-box--layout-image-left elementor-author-box--align-left elementor-widget elementor-widget-author-box\" data-id=\"6c583e2\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"author-box.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-author-box\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div  class=\"elementor-author-box__avatar\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"https:\/\/dduconnect.in\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/12\/icon-login-3.jpg-300x300.png\" alt=\"Priya Rathod\">\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-author-box__text\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div >\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3 class=\"elementor-author-box__name\">Priya Rathod<\/h3>\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-author-box__bio\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>IT 4th SEM <\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/section>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t",

There are a pile of clothes sitting across me since last week. I can smell a certain foul smell around me which certainly must be due to my irregular shower schedule. I can feel my roommate&#8217;s disapproving glares burning on my back. The afternoon sunshine forces me to shut my eyes close. I am just about to fall back into another slumber when her face comes in front of my mind&#8217;s eye. The little energy I had gained since my last meal slowly fades away. I force myself to fall asleep harder, promising to not get up until all my problems have solved themselves. After an hour of unfulfilling sleep, I push myself up and into my clammy little washroom. The mirror greets me with her face, I splash cold water on my face trying to rub her mark off of me but once again her tired, sad, lifeless eyes stare back at me. I try to remember since when she started affecting me so much. I remember briefly meeting her on lonely Saturdays and how she was there for me when my trips back to home were canceled at last minute or how she lent her shoulder to try on during my fallouts with friends.<\/p><p>Oh, how na\u00efve I was to fall for her pretenses. She came in my life with the tag as &#8220;self-care&#8221; and ended up being like a parasite, sucking the life out of my soul. Maybe it was her scared eyes or love deprived heart that pulled me towards her. Or it could even be how well she knew and understood me. Of course, she would know me inside out, she was me after all, granted she was the sadder version of me but still me. During the start of our relationship, she would just meet me occasionally, and then I started noticing her being on my tail whenever I was out having fun. She didn\u2019t object much when I laughed at my friends\u2019 joke or during a fun movie but she would murmur to me how my laugh resembles a pig\u2019s snort and how I look like an ugly duckling among my friends. Her disapproval made me unable to even smile in front of others. Soon the invisible girl took the reins of my life and asked me to take a backseat.<\/p><p>I started bunking lectures and sleeping in on account of minor inconveniences. It old myself it was only because I was tired and won\u2019t be able to study in class with my headache. But soon those occasional bunks became frequent. I slept for 10hr sat a stretch almost every night but not ones in the morning did I ever feel refreshed. I got ready the same every day, not forgetting my hygiene once but my face had a strange sort of dullness. I couldn\u2019t understand what was taught in lectures and attended labs just for the sake of attendance.<\/p><p>The wrecked girl had started it all, smiling slyly in my shadow when I saw my disheartening internal results. \u201cStop it!\u201d my best friend had shouted at me. She had come to console me and I had really tried to listen but I could see her floating behind my friend. \u201cStop with those \u2018lost eyes\u2019 of yours,\u201d she said exasperated, \u201cthis has been going on for way to long. You hardly talk and on those rare occasions when you do, you won\u2019t look us in the eye. Whatever it is you are going through needs to stop.\u201d<\/p><p>That cold evening after I promised my friend I would med my ways, I called her. She wasn\u2019t someone who came on being called, she was the queen of her own mind. But there must have been something in my tone that she showed up. \u201cWho are you and why wouldn\u2019t you leave me alone.\u201d That was the day when she told me her name for the first time. She called herself depression. I was unable to accept the fact that I had been chilling out with depression since the past few weeks. The gravity of the situation finally hit me and I begged her to move out of my life and never show her face again. She simply laughed at my face and told me how I wouldn\u2019t survive without her. She wasn\u2019t wrong but I was willing to take the risk. \u201cYou are worthless\u201d, she told me. I lashed out at depression begging her through my blurred vision to leave me. But she stood her ground. Not moving an inch. \u201cPlease, I don\u2019t want this life\u201d, I cried. \u201cThen take it.\u201d She smirked. I gasped. After a few hours of pointless name-calling, I gave up. Like always.<\/p><p>It has been a whole week since that episode, and I have never felt so drained of energy in my whole life. But I haven&#8217;t completely given up yet. I am still adamant about not being depressed. I fall back on my unmade bed and pick up my barely charged phone and call my parents. Each passing ring shrinks my will power. \u201cHi, beta\u201d, those two words are enough for me to break down. In between my muffled sobs, I ask my parents to save me from her.<\/p><\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/section>\n\t\t\t\t<section class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-f061310 elementor-section-boxed elementor-section-height-default elementor-section-height-default elementor-section elementor-top-section\" data-id=\"f061310\" data-element_type=\"section\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-container elementor-column-gap-default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-row\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"aux-parallax-section elementor-element elementor-element-848b797 elementor-column elementor-col-100 elementor-top-column\" data-id=\"848b797\" data-element_type=\"column\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-column-wrap  elementor-element-populated\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-wrap\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-e5f0222 elementor-author-box--layout-image-left elementor-author-box--align-left elementor-widget elementor-widget-author-box\" data-id=\"e5f0222\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"author-box.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-author-box\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div  class=\"elementor-author-box__avatar\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"https:\/\/dduconnect.in\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/12\/DIVYESHREE-500x500-300x300.jpg\" alt=\"Divyashree Iyer\">\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-author-box__text\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div >\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3 class=\"elementor-author-box__name\">Divyashree Iyer<\/h3>\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-author-box__bio\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>IT, 4th Sem.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/section>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t",

It was his friend, Jack who broke the tragic news in the subtlest way possible, dropping hints and letting him uncover the story. His stepfather Mr Connor Ryan had died a few hours ago, in an accident amongst several others. It was so brutal that the incident was in the face of every news channel headline. Jack took his time to confirm the accuracy of the news before delivering it. But no matter how many times he would ask or check the list of the dead people, Robin\u2019s stepfather was still there on the list.<br \/>Robin\u2019s face was utterly blank, devoid of any emotions. A tear dropped from his left eye, the only indication of the abyss of grief he was falling into. When he was out of the eye of the storm of sorrow, he stood up and went to the balcony, shutting the door behind him, locking himself alone. There was a chair facing the brisk wind. Contemplating the series of events that had followed a few minutes ago, he slowly sank into the seat. The physical exhaustion that seemed to come from the grief of the loss was slowly sinking into his bones. He tried to focus on his surroundings to get out of the abyss, even so temporarily. The leaves were changing its colour from warm green to ochre-brown indicating change and thus the arrival of autumn. On the streets below, a toddler was being strolled by his grandpa. The birds were seen to be feeding their babies. No matter where he looked or shifted his focus, he could only see the unavoidable transition of life-forms from life to death, whether it may be the faintest notes he could hear someone hitting far away or the bright sun in the sky that will eventually be replaced by the moon.<br \/>Head thrown on the cushion of the chair, body pretty much motionless, and ethereal self still falling into the abyss, his dead eyes continued to look towards the sky. Something was coming to him. He was too engrossed in his thoughts that until a cold wave hit him hard, he didn&#8217;t realize it. He could not quite wrap his mind around it, it was too subtle. But, the presence was there.<br \/>Now, his heart-beats started changing its wave as the realization started hitting him quite so ever faintly and slowly, becoming a little strong on every hit. He was trying to fight it with all his might which had been rendered useless due to the emotional blow received from what seems like days ago, but to no avail. While he let himself be consumed by it, his heart said something that was unknown to him, what he had thought only came in his dreams- \u201cfreedom\u201d. He couldn\u2019t believe it until those lips of his parted and he heard the vocal cord of his throat made the same voice. The dead eyes were slowly gaining life, or to say an entirely new life. He did not consider asking himself if the feeling of pure joy might be atrocious. What he was seeing was only his free life and nothing else. He did not hate him. Although, sometimes he was treated in a biased manner by his stepfather as compared to his step-siblings. He had forgotten about his stepfather\u2019s anger issues, how he\u2019d let it out on him and how pure cruel he was at times. Still, he loved him. Also, now it doesn\u2019t matter. He\u2019d found something more than love itself- freedom.<br \/>The train of his thoughts was stopped when his friend called him from the other side of the door. His friend was worried that he might never come out of the abyss of darkness. But he was soaring in the limitless sky that he had just discovered.<br \/>He opened the door to his friend\u2019s importunities. He clasped his shoulders and descended the stairs. A click sound came from the door. A man in his early 40s entered the room. It was Connor, and he was perfectly well, maybe a little travel-soiled but far from harm\u2019s way. He didn\u2019t even know about any such accident where he\u2019d supposedly met his death, he was far from it. Jack justified his immature decision, thinking someone must have made a typo in Connor\u2019s name which was not very uncommon. Just then, Jack felt the hands on his shoulders slipping away. Alas, he was an instant too late to realize. Connor stood amazed at the sight of Robin\u2019s falling body and his friend trying to catch him.<br \/>When the doctors came, they said that Robin had died of heart disease- of a joy that kills.<\/p><\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/section>\n\t\t\t\t<section class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-1254f35 elementor-section-boxed elementor-section-height-default elementor-section-height-default elementor-section elementor-top-section\" data-id=\"1254f35\" data-element_type=\"section\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-container elementor-column-gap-default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-row\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"aux-parallax-section elementor-element elementor-element-e75be96 elementor-column elementor-col-100 elementor-top-column\" data-id=\"e75be96\" data-element_type=\"column\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-column-wrap  elementor-element-populated\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-wrap\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-5060a86 elementor-author-box--layout-image-left elementor-author-box--align-left elementor-widget elementor-widget-author-box\" data-id=\"5060a86\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"author-box.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-author-box\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div  class=\"elementor-author-box__avatar\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"https:\/\/dduconnect.in\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/11\/UTSAV-300x300.jpeg\" alt=\"Utsav Parmar\">\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-author-box__text\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div >\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3 class=\"elementor-author-box__name\">Utsav Parmar<\/h3>\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-author-box__bio\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>CE, 5th Sem.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/section>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t",

I would gaze at the sky, trying to spot constellations and imagine the object it portrayed by joining the dots. Orion was the easiest one. Although, I didn\u2019t stay transfixed for hours as they so romantically put it. It did pique my curiosity. And now here I am, 1300 light years away in the middle of the same Orion, on the first ever space civilisation setup by humans. Maybe, someone is looking at us from the Earth.\u201d, Andrews said and waved his hand at the sky.<\/p><div><p>\u00a0<\/p><div>\u201cIt sounds magnanimous sir!\u201d, ANNE replied.<\/div><p>\u00a0<\/p><div>It had been 100 days since the inception of Andrea- a second home to humans. Andrea wasn\u2019t the Earth like planet that we found and inhabited. It was a huge ring structure built around a spinning blackhole using metals extracted from nearby exoplanets. Andrea was built at just the right distance and it rotated with just the right speed to counterbalance black hole\u2019s pull and gravity was as good as that on the Earth. They threaded superconducting coils through black hole\u2019s horizon to tap the electricity to surface of Andrea, just like a dynamo. And it would be eons before it ran out of power.<\/div><p>\u00a0<\/p><div>\u201cSir, I think We should head back to the station. Such long exposures may cause cellular mutations inside your body.\u201d, ANNE said. Andrews never had second thoughts to what ANNE said because he believed it was incorruptible as it wasn\u2019t a human in first place; a robot. They got into the aircraft and reached a tiny cubicle where there was a helipad marked X. Once the aircraft landed there, helipad started descending slowly and inside lay a beautiful city- ellipsoidal edifices and lakes forming perfect circles scattered amidst labyrinth of flora and fauna. Andrews manoeuvred his aircraft to his lab.<\/div><p>\u00a0<\/p><div>Andrews was the chief engineer of this project Andrea. A project this daunting and so massive had never been done before. Today, they were going to take another great leap. They were going to look inside the black hole and try to find out the missing pieces to the \u2018Theory of Everything\u2019 which If successful could even pave the way to constructing a Time Machine. Dr. Michael was harbouring a great expectation from this experiment of peeking inside the black hole. He called it the most ambitious project of his life. Dr. Michael was also at helm of project Andrea. He was a prodigy; a brilliant mathematician and a leading theoretical physicist of 24th century. He took Einstein\u2019s legacy a step further and reconciled Quantum mechanics with General relativity. If it weren\u2019t for him, Andrea would have fallen back by several millennia, for he decoded the science behind wormholes and assisted in developing the technology to create a wormhole from solar system to Orion Nebula, a tunnel through hyperspace which reduced the distance of 1300 light years to about 200 million kilometres. He was indeed a man ahead of his time.<\/div><p>\u00a0<\/p><div>Just hours before the experiment, Andrews had bitter argument with him. He was ominous.<\/div><p>\u00a0<\/p><div>\u201cDr. Michael, I have some reservations about this experiment of yours. I think we shouldn\u2019t experiment with these mystic particles- primordial blackholes, something that we don\u2019t yet understand fully.\u201d<\/div><p>\u00a0<\/p><div>\u201cCalm down Andrews. Do you understand how fortunate we have been to have had the opportunity to study primordial blackholes- miniscule particles which were supposedly originated during the origin of universe and are perhaps the miniature models of the black hole we\u2019ll try to probe today. If we never try how will we ever know anything.\u201d<\/div><p>\u00a0<\/p><div>\u201cBut sir, do you understand the gravity of the possible consequences of the experiment? It may result into a catastrophic series of events which will jeopardise Andrea and even result into total destruction of life system that we\u2019ve built here. Sir, I entreat you to abort this experiment.\u201d<\/div><p>\u00a0<\/p><div>\u201cI have never been wrong, and I don\u2019t see why that should change. Once I have accomplished this, I will have surpassed all the greats ever (sighs). Just take a leap of faith with me, Andrews.\u201d<\/div><p>\u00a0<\/p><div>Dr. Michael scoffed and stormed out of the room. Andrews knew that Doctor had gone past the point of no return.<\/div><p>\u00a0<\/p><div>\u201cT-30 seconds to launch. All systems are fully functional and responsive.\u201d The entire team of Dr. Michael held their breath as they watched ANNE start descend towards the black hole. It carried a capsule containing primordial black hole in a perfect vacuum, isolated from all disturbances. ANNE\u2019s signals received at Andrea began experiencing red shift, turning into longer and longer wavelengths as it descended further down, which was as expected. ANNE started revolving in orbit just outside event horizon, a region beyond which even light cannot escape hole\u2019s pull.<\/div><p>\u00a0<\/p><div>\u201cSir, there\u2019s some erratic activity in our orbit. Detection of gravitational waves and rise in temperatures. Thrust power requirement is greater than the calculated value.\u201d, ANNE transmitted message to Andrea. Everyone started sweating profusely when they heard this, except Dr. Michael. \u201cKeep sending the data ANNE.\u201d, he replied.<\/div><p>\u00a0<\/p><div>Suddenly, capsule broke open and distorted black mass emancipated itself. Primordial Blackhole began growing at a rapid rate and soon turned into a colossal monster.<\/div><p>\u00a0<\/p><div>All hell broke loose at Andrea. The primordial black hole had begun engulfing the other black hole and its enormous pull would soon spaghettify Andrea. Ambition and vanity had clouded Dr. Michael\u2019s judgement and entire humanity had to pay the price. Andrews immediately initiated evacuation. They had spacecrafts which could be mobilised in very short time. Dr. Michael seated paralysed with horror whilst others began leaving hastily. He had sunk into abyss of regret and remorse. Andrews had to carry the frozen Doctor to the spacecraft. He watched from space Andrea disintegrate and amalgamate with stars lying inside the blackhole.<\/div><\/div><\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/section>\n\t\t\t\t<section class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-584eb8c elementor-section-boxed elementor-section-height-default elementor-section-height-default elementor-section elementor-top-section\" data-id=\"584eb8c\" data-element_type=\"section\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-container elementor-column-gap-default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-row\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"aux-parallax-section elementor-element elementor-element-c10ab68 elementor-column elementor-col-100 elementor-top-column\" data-id=\"c10ab68\" data-element_type=\"column\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-column-wrap\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-wrap\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/section>\n\t\t\t\t<section class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-0f23973 elementor-section-boxed elementor-section-height-default elementor-section-height-default elementor-section elementor-top-section\" data-id=\"0f23973\" data-element_type=\"section\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-container elementor-column-gap-default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-row\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"aux-parallax-section elementor-element elementor-element-32616ee elementor-column elementor-col-100 elementor-top-column\" data-id=\"32616ee\" data-element_type=\"column\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-column-wrap  elementor-element-populated\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-wrap\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-bc3a670 elementor-widget elementor-widget-author-box\" data-id=\"bc3a670\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"author-box.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-author-box\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div  class=\"elementor-author-box__avatar\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"https:\/\/dduconnect.in\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/11\/PARTH-M-300x300.jpeg\" alt=\"Parth Mamtora\">\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-author-box__text\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div >\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"elementor-author-box__name\">Parth Mamtora<\/h4>\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-author-box__bio\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>MH, 6th Sem.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/section>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t",

I loved spending holidays at my grandmother\u2019s. It was the love that she showered on me that made me wanting to visit her. Also, her neighborhood had become so accepting and amiable that when it was the time to part from her for the hostel again, it made my eyes fill with tears of love. &#8211; Lying on the hospital bed, I try to spill the memories into my diary. My handwriting has never been worse. With every moment passing, I comprehend sentence after sentence and wonder why I did not write earlier. It has not been more than seven hours that I woke up from the prolonged unconsciousness of five long years. Seldom does my brain help me track memories down to the root, but today it is different. It is almost as if it wants me to recollect everything till the point I failed.<\/p><p>It was the 23rd of December, five years back. Like every year, I was at my grandmother&#8217;s. It was very unusual of me to wake up early in the morning for exercise. But, that day had something different in store for me. I set out at seven, running along the fence of the garden in my new sneakers. Eight rounds down, tired and resting on a bench while sipping water, I saw a girl on the other side of the road. There was a charm on her face that made me keen to know more about her.<\/p><p>It had been three days and all I had done was stare at her and look away when she would catch a sight of me. Gathering all the courage on the fourth day, I walked up to her and asked, &#8220;Do you mind if I sit here?&#8221; She nodded. Brown eyes, dark, curly hair and a round, fair face. She seemed as serene as the winter morning. We sat on the same bench for ten minutes but I could not utter a word. In an attempt to know\u00a0 her, I had collected some information about her. I came to know that she was my grandmother\u2019s neighbor\u2019s niece who lived in Australia and had come to visit her aunt. After calculating the odds of being able to or not being able to talk to her ever, I decided to initiate. Our talks hardly lasted for five minutes as she always seemed to be in a hurry to reach home.<\/p><p>Not many days had passed, atleast it didn\u2019t seem like they had; and before I managed to have a talk which didn\u2019t end in five minutes, it was time for me to go. I decided to bid her a farewell in a very special way. I woke up early in the morning and reached the garden a few minutes before my usual time. To my surprise, I saw her getting into a car. Maybe she was leaving for Australia. For a moment, I felt like I would never see her again. &#8220;But, will I give up so easily?&#8221;, I thought. With that, I accelerated and ran towards her car. A moment ago she was there, across the road; the next moment everything went black.<\/p><p>Today, it is the 25th of December. I should have been at my grandmother\u2019s. Instead, I am lying on a hospital bed, covered with a boring white sheet. I am told that I was hit by a bus and suffered a serious brain injury. My thoughts aren\u2019t clear but, even in this swirl I can distinctly remember her face, smiling at me. I just want to get out of this room, go to my grandmother&#8217;s neighbor and ask about her. I have lost all hopes and made peace with the fact that not all stories have a happy ending. With that notion, I close my diary and put it in the drawer next to my bed. Just as I shut the drawer, I hear a knock on the door. I see flowers through the glass door and a girl smiling widely at me. I remember that smile. I remember those brown eyes. I ring the bell as an acknowledgement and as the door opens, I feel blood rushing through my face. She has got prettier, I think.<\/p><\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/section>\n\t\t\t\t<section class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-351d708 elementor-section-boxed elementor-section-height-default elementor-section-height-default elementor-section elementor-top-section\" data-id=\"351d708\" data-element_type=\"section\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-container elementor-column-gap-default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-row\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"aux-parallax-section elementor-element elementor-element-483e7c2 elementor-column elementor-col-100 elementor-top-column\" data-id=\"483e7c2\" data-element_type=\"column\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-column-wrap  elementor-element-populated\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-wrap\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-dbbcd26 elementor-author-box--layout-image-left elementor-author-box--align-left elementor-author-box--image-valign-middle elementor-widget elementor-widget-author-box\" data-id=\"dbbcd26\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"author-box.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-author-box\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div  class=\"elementor-author-box__avatar\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"https:\/\/dduconnect.in\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/11\/HARSHIL-300x300.jpeg\" alt=\"Harshil Kapadia\">\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-author-box__text\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div >\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3 class=\"elementor-author-box__name\">Harshil Kapadia<\/h3>\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-author-box__bio\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>CE, 6th Sem.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/section>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t",

Each of them carried a semi-automatic assault rifle, a short range pistol gun and the badge on their breast pocket read \u2018Sarvatra Izzat O Iqbal.\u2019 In a split second, the soldiers had divided themselves in group of twos and rampaged through the entire house, the next moment a shout was heard; confirming that they had found what they were looking for. Miriam stood numb as soldiers carried away her bother right in front of her eyes. Tariq shot a glance at Miriam as he was walked out; their eyes met and Miriam could sense an appeal of help in her brother\u2019s eyes. However, before Miriam could compose herself to make a tangible reaction, the soldier hit the butt of his assault rifle down Tariq\u2019s back and the whole house trembled with Tariq\u2019s shriek of agony.<\/p><p>This was two years back. The entire village had witnessed this tragic episode and it grieved for Miriam\u2019s loss. Miriam\u2019s own grief had been second to none, everyone who had watched her breakdown were humbled with compassion and felt a certain sensation of ire against Indian army. Miriam\u2019s whole community was an ally to Indian army. They were eyes and ears who could keep watch at unfenced borders of Kashmir valley. They often dwelled their herds of sheep in those greener patches near the Line of Control, an are which often stayed out of army vigil. Bakarwal shepherds had also played a pivotal role during war of 1965 and 1991; informing the army about Pakistani infiltration. However, Tariq\u2019s arrest had breached all the trust that evolved during those years.<\/p><p>Miriam sat on her calves, trying to pray and tranquil her anxious mind but unsuccessful. Today was the most important day of her life. Finally, she stood at the threshold of accomplishing her \u2018Maksad.\u2019 One final step!<\/p><p>Miriam was conduit of Islamic state, a terrorist group in eyes of government and freedom fighters for those like Miriam. She wished to walk the path of \u2018Jihad\u2019 to restore harmony in her motherland. Miriam smirked to herself as she remembered how she overcame every difficulty; the biggest one being eliminating her own brother. Tariq had begun getting suspicious about her. He had seen Miriam pelting stones at army, found out about her receiving \u2018Jihad\u2019 teachings from Chacha Abdul. He tried to preach Miriam about how Kashmir had become a purgatory; a land torn between conflicts of two nations and \u2018Jihad\u2019 was only going to aggravate the situation. He had spoken of article 370 of the constitution of India which granted a special status to their status. How could Miriam\u2019s conscience let her soul stay at peace if she betrayed the nation that offered her so much?<br \/>Miriam had stayed impervious to Tariq\u2019s utterings but felt herself vulnerable. So, she herself tipped off her comrade in army confinement to name Tariq has his accomplice. Thence, Miriam hadn\u2019t looked back and silently kept preparing for this day. The chief Minister was going to arrive in the city to inaugurate the newly formed bridge over river Jhelum. Miriam was going to blow him to pieces and herself too.<\/p><p>It was nearly the time now. She strapped two rolls of fluffy looking plastic explosives at her belly and put on her favourite blue dress over it and a scarlet hijab round her face. She then went to Chacha Abdul\u2019s residence, her mentor in this crusade of hers. He blessed her and gave a rose garland, a parting gift intended for the honourable chief minister.<br \/>Miriam reached the site of inauguration two hours prior to event, yet magnitude of crowd that showed up was massive. She thought it would be quite a spectacle here when she unleashes her fireworks. However, she wasn\u2019t the part of the crowd, she sat ahead of the barricades in VIP zone on those ergonomic sofas. She sat patiently for one hour and though she knew everything was going as planned, her throat was running dry. And then it happened!<\/p><p>There was a tap on Miriam\u2019s shoulders and when she turned back, her whole world toppled down. It was Tariq and behind him were team of commandos. \u201cHow could it be? Was Tariq\u2019s arrest sham? Am I outplayed?\u201d, thoughts running quickly in Miriam\u2019s mind. Instinctively, her hands stretched towards her purse to take out the detonation remote. \u201cIt\u2019s useless! We jammed microwaves too, the spectrum your naughty remote operates on\u201d Tariq said and Miriam frantically kept twitching her remote. She couldn\u2019t make spectacle happen.<\/p><\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/section>\n\t\t\t\t<section class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-5a05c50 elementor-section-boxed elementor-section-height-default elementor-section-height-default elementor-section elementor-top-section\" data-id=\"5a05c50\" data-element_type=\"section\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-container elementor-column-gap-default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-row\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"aux-parallax-section elementor-element elementor-element-b587ecb elementor-column elementor-col-100 elementor-top-column\" data-id=\"b587ecb\" data-element_type=\"column\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-column-wrap  elementor-element-populated\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-wrap\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-e0eae5f elementor-author-box--layout-image-left elementor-author-box--align-left elementor-author-box--image-valign-middle elementor-widget elementor-widget-author-box\" data-id=\"e0eae5f\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"author-box.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-author-box\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div  class=\"elementor-author-box__avatar\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"https:\/\/dduconnect.in\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/11\/PARTH-M-300x300.jpeg\" alt=\"Parth Momtora\">\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-author-box__text\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div >\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3 class=\"elementor-author-box__name\">Parth Momtora<\/h3>\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-author-box__bio\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>MH, 6th Sem.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/section>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t",

Nonchalant yet the most energetic girl, with no friends at all in the hostel, enjoyed her grandfather&#8217;s company every Sunday. It had become an escape from the loneliness of hostel for her. Whenever he arrived, she felt as if her world was getting decorated by the flowers, chocolates, balloons and the happiness her grandpa brought for her. Every walk would become yet another tale of fun and love and embellish the memories of childhood which wouldn&#8217;t have existed without him. Every walk was a tour to their world of imaginations. Being the only family left of hers, her grandfather, Shankar, never let her feel alone. Without speaking to her on the telephone, he couldn&#8217;t sleep peacefully. All his peace was in her comfort. This grandfather-granddaughter duet filled the void of each other&#8217;s life.<br \/>On that day she had waited too long for him to come. It was already dusk, the stars were twinkling in the night and with every passing second, she was becoming more and more impatient. Though the night was cold and chilling, the warmth of her anger shielded her from coming into the grasp of cold. In that chilling night, when the surrounding was serene, and the nocturnal creatures were awake, she saw a bright and thin, a not so tall figure growing at the distance. As the figure was growing larger and larger, she kept becoming perplexed to see that the outline was resembling with her grandfather&#8217;s. Then, she saw his curly grey hairs, dark complexion, white beard jutting out of his chin with a stick in his tender hands and his wobbly walking gait of a toddler who has learned to walk a few days ago. Eventually in the dull lights of street lamp she identified her grandfather in full white kurta and pajama with a heavenly smile on his wrinkled face. She ran barefoot towards him and cuddled him tightly whilst tears rolling down her cheeks. They both were as still as statue for next few minutes and then they sat down. As usual, before beginning their walk, he shared a little piece of chocolate with her. It was customary for Riya to have a chocolate or else she won\u2019t allow Shankar to take her on walk.<br \/>&#8220;So, what are we waiting for?&#8221;<br \/>&#8220;All your patience is exhausted, and I can feel that&#8221;, he laughed gently.<br \/>Without waiting anymore, they began their walk. While they were shivering on their walk, a butterfly with glittering white wings sat on her nose. A little scared yet brave Ria touched its gentle wings very tenderly and then in the empty surroundings, the glimmering butterflies emerged out of nowhere, flying all around them. From heaven to the earth, wherever their eyes went their sight met those colorful butterflies which encircled them. It added the warmth of colors to their cold walk under the black sky. Though that mesmerizing effect lasted for a short time, it aroused a warm sentiment they wouldn\u2019t forget for lifetime. Riya&#8217;s smile spread as wide as it could, and her grandfather was lost in her surreal happiness. They continued their walk and after a few miles they were amidst the woods in a garden besides which a river was flowing. The wind was whistling, the leaves were rumbling, and the water of the river was burbling on the uneven riverbed. Also, the leaves were falling ever so slowly over their heads due to the gentle wind blowing through the mingled branches of trees. They both felt as if that shower of leaves was a warm welcome to this rhythmic place of the nature. She could sense a melody in this noise. She forced Shankar to dance and when they danced, she laughed aloud seeing him dance with such tranquility. It could be clearly seen that the loudness of her laughter was soothing his ears. Following that rhythm, now they were on a plain which was ascending gradually toward the sky. Finally, they reached a land where the branches of the only maple tree in the town were waving with the wind. They lay down there and observed the midnight moon shining brightly over their heads. They talked about their happy and sad moments during that week. Suddenly, Shankar rose and soared toward the sky into the darkness, behind the moon, where the land of heaven was hidden and became a star which twinkled brighter than every other star in the sky.<\/p><\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/section>\n\t\t\t\t<section class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-3a7b2f7 elementor-section-boxed elementor-section-height-default elementor-section-height-default elementor-section elementor-top-section\" data-id=\"3a7b2f7\" data-element_type=\"section\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-container elementor-column-gap-default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-row\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"aux-parallax-section elementor-element elementor-element-185a706 elementor-column elementor-col-100 elementor-top-column\" data-id=\"185a706\" data-element_type=\"column\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-column-wrap  elementor-element-populated\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-wrap\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-10328fc elementor-author-box--layout-image-left elementor-author-box--align-left elementor-author-box--image-valign-top elementor-widget elementor-widget-author-box\" data-id=\"10328fc\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"author-box.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-author-box\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div  class=\"elementor-author-box__avatar\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"https:\/\/dduconnect.in\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/11\/LOKESH-300x300.jpeg\" alt=\"Lokesh Narwani\">\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-author-box__text\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div >\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3 class=\"elementor-author-box__name\">Lokesh Narwani<\/h3>\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-author-box__bio\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>EC, 4th Sem.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/section>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t",

It was all they could hear. Everyone in the courtroom could sense the nervousness in her demeanor. Fear and anxiety were written all over her face. The surroundings and the scrutinizing glances were completely new to the thirteen-year-old girl. Having lived a sheltered life for years, it was tough facing such a judgment alone for the first time.<\/p><p>As the judge arrived, all the whispers died. With a bored expression on his wrinkled face, he settled into his place and started the session. &#8220;Good morning ladies and gentlemen. The court is now in session. We call case no. 2468, Mr. Aakash Sharma versus Miss Meena Sharma. The accused is held against the charges of stealing 10, 00,000 rupees cash from Mr. Aakash Singh. So Miss Meena, what would you like to say in your defense?&#8221;<\/p><p>The betrayal from her dear ones caused her voice to choke. Unable to hold composure, she burst into tears. As though unmoved by her cries the old man spoke, &#8220;You have nothing to fear if you are right my child. Speak if you want to prove your innocence.\u201d Suddenly filled with determination, she wiped her tears and spoke, \u201cMy family used to live in a farm outside of the village. But due to crop failure, my father and mother committed suicide one day. None of my relatives came to help after.&#8221;<br \/>&#8220;What nonsense is this? Are we here for a trial or pity party? This is outrageous!&#8221; &#8220;Please Mr. Aakash, wait for your turn to speak. You continue, my child.&#8221; The judge spoke making the angry Aakash Sharma quiet. Meena continued in a broken tone, \u201cIt was very hard Sahib. No one was willing to let us stay in our home or enter school. The bank people came and confiscated the farm. I tried finding work but the times were hard, Sahib. Somehow I managed to feed my brother and sister. But with my parents, my luck also expired. I could only make 20 or 30 rupees per week doing odd jobs. I had two little siblings to feed, sahib. So I used to take some leftovers every day from Aakash Kaka&#8217;s shop. When I took the bread that day, my only thought was to feed something to my little Ansh who was suffering from fever from two days. I did not steal the money, Sahib. I only wanted food. Does this make me a thief judge Sahib?&#8221; asked Meena with glistening orbs, pleading for her innocence.<br \/>The courtroom was filled with silence once again. But this time the pre-teen did not feel the weight of judgmental stares. Instead, she felt everyone looking at her with an emotion which was almost, also there on the judge&#8217;s face- pity and sympathy. Some were even sobbing silently hearing the miserable tale. Except for one. The judge asked, &#8220;Would you like to say something, Mr. Aakash Sharma?&#8221;<br \/>&#8220;This girl is trying to fool everyone here, my lord. I very well know girls like her. A few tears here and there; they think anyone can be fooled. Taking pity to her condition and the fact that she is my niece, I adopted her. But she insisted on staying in the hut with her siblings. So I thought to let her stay in the daytime- so that she has food and clothes. Around a few weeks ago I started noticing articles missing from my home- cutlery, crockery, and some garments. Many times I found Meena giving longing looks to all the ornaments. It was only last week that I found her with a satchel containing food and some clothes. She must have stolen the money the same way. My lord, do not get carried away by her crocodile tears, look at the malice behind her eyes. I say check that tattered hut of hers, the money must surely be there&#8221;, he spat out with disdain coating his tone.<\/p><p>Gasps were heard in the courtroom upon the cruel statements and blatant accusations thrown at Meena. But she calmly presented her argument,\u201dMy lord I work at the house of my kaka as a maid. Only when he knew about my farm being named after my guardian, he took me in. I didn\u2019t steal anything from their house. If I really had cash with me, by now I would have fled the city with my siblings.
