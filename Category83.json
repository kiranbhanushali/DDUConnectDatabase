Then he suddenly whispered, \u201cIt\u2019s July 25th today a few weeks left for my birthday. A whole year has passed. It\u2019s been a year since I lost you my dearest Anita, a year since I shifted here with our son John, a year since I left the country where I grew up, a year since I have started talking to myself the whole day. Of course, your son does take care of me, he takes time out to talk to me. But he too has a family to look after. But the striking resemblance of our grandson Rohan does remind me of you daily. Here I have every material possession a man my age could ask for but as you already know not all desires are earthly. I often pass my time looking at my childhood picture frames. But it\u2019s more fun talking to you. Seems like I have bored you enough. I will go back to tending to my flowers. \u201d<\/p>\n<p>That night his grandson looked at his frames and inquired,\u201dGrandpa who is this man? He is present in almost every photo of your school and college&#8217;s picture frames.\u201d To which Rakesh smilingly answered, \u201cSon, he is your Grandpa\u2019s best friend and so &#8211; called partner in crime. We were together from the beginning of the school till the end of our college life. And ironically his name was also Rakesh Gupta.\u201d \u201cYou can\u2019t be serious, both of you shared the same name,\u201d John exclaimed with a burst of laughter. \u201cYes, in fact, we were a duo. We were always together in our school and college days. In fact, during our college days, a girl who liked Rakesh mistook my bag for his and placed a love letter in it. In the letter, she asked him to meet her at the caf\u00e9. So I went there counting my lucky stars. Isat on the table she was sitting on. We stared awkwardly like owls at each other for a good ten minutes until she finally realized the blunder she had made and broke the silence. And I can\u2019t count the number of times I have gone to the Principal\u2019s office listening to his share of scolding.\u201d He said smiling sheepishly. \u201cWell, those days have long gone in the past. Now I can only rewind those days with the support of these pictures.\u201d John who was eavesdropping the entire conversation murmured to himself, \u201cI achieved everything a man could ask for yet I find myself incapable of providing my father with the happiness he truly deserves. Have I failed as a son?\u201d He sighed. Saying those words he retired to his room with guilt buried deep in his heart.<\/p>\n<p>A few weeks later, Rakesh received an unexpected courier from India. At first, he was sceptical as to who could have sent it to him. But then without giving it much thought he decided to open it and found a letter on the top of the gift &#8211; wrapped courier. He opened the letter only to find the name of his friend Rakesh B. Gupta on the top of the letter. He was shocked and stared at the letter with a complete blank drawn on his face but then he decided to call his son but his phone appeared to be busy. So without giving it a great deal of thought, he decided to deliver the parcel to the correct address all by himself carrying a small ray of hope in his heart. His mind was filled with all sorts of questions and brimming with an uncontained outburst of excitement. So he rushed to the recipient\u2019s address without a second of thought and rang the bell to his door.<\/p>\n<p>His mind was a blank slate, his heart was racing, he didn\u2019t know what to expect. To his surprise, he found his son on the front door with a joyous and expectant smile on his face. Before he could catch a breath and recollect himself he saw an old man with a welcoming smile he remembered for years. \u201cSeems like your hair count finally matches your IQ count.\u201d He chuckled. The face was different but the smile and the remark brought tears to his eyes as he said, \u201cRakesh, it\u2019s truly you. I can\u2019t believe my eyes.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s your birthday gift dad. I know I am slightly early this time. But hey who doesn\u2019t like advance presents.\u201d said John. \u201cBless my lucky stars. I was sitting at the same caf\u00e9 your old friend visited. And considering the number times, I have heard the tales of your endeavours it didn\u2019t take me much time to recognize him.\u201d He added. \u201cYou never opened the present did you Dad. Since now you know that it\u2019s officially yours feel free to open it.\u201d On unwrapping, he found another photo frame with an inscription, \u2018To the craziness of the past and the smiles of the future.\u2019 With a teary smile, Rakesh replied, \u201cThank you so much, son. I couldn\u2019t have asked for a better present or a better son.&#8221;<\/p><\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/section>\n\t\t\t\t<section class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-f9c2d27 elementor-section-boxed elementor-section-height-default elementor-section-height-default elementor-section elementor-top-section\" data-id=\"f9c2d27\" data-element_type=\"section\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-container elementor-column-gap-default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-row\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"aux-parallax-section elementor-element elementor-element-9bbc2e1 elementor-column elementor-col-100 elementor-top-column\" data-id=\"9bbc2e1\" data-element_type=\"column\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-column-wrap  elementor-element-populated\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-wrap\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-8ac731d elementor-author-box--layout-image-left elementor-author-box--align-left elementor-widget elementor-widget-author-box\" data-id=\"8ac731d\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"author-box.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-author-box\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div  class=\"elementor-author-box__avatar\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"https:\/\/dduconnect.in\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/12\/icon-login-3.jpg-300x300.png\" alt=\"Mufaddal J.

Adityan, holding a coconut stepped into the temple. Inside, everything was yellow coloured and everything smelled of recent rain. He went straight to the kuthambalam were his favourite play Kathakali was being performed.<br \/><\/strong><strong><br \/>It didn\u2019t matter to him that the Kathakali had begun hours before he came. For him, they were as familiar as the house he lived in. The plays didn\u2019t surprise him with the unforeseen. Adityan sat there with his back against a white pillar. On the stage he watched a man playing the role of Karna, the great and generous warrior. Adityan thought to himself \u2018Karna\u2019s oath\u2019 and smiled at his own intelligence of remembering the name of the part being performed from his childhood. Karna, the desolate son of Sun, the abandoned child was praying near the banks of the Ganga. It was the scene just before the great Mahabharata yudh(war).<br \/><\/strong><strong><br \/>Then the red-eyed Kunti appeared. The role of Kunti was too performed by a man but with ample bosoms. She had come to tell Karna a story. She told him about a young beautiful woman who had been gifted a boon. A mantra, that she could choose a lover from the gods. To test if it really worked, she went to an empty field in the morning. Closing both the eyes and facing the clear blue sky, she recited the mantra. When she opened her eyes, she saw the Lord Sun, the god of the day himself appeared before her. Charmed by the beauty of shimmering God, she gave herself to him. Nine months later, she had a son. Kunti said the young woman loved her son more than anything that existed for her but her fate had other plans. She couldn\u2019t keep him as she was unmarried. So she put him in a basket and cast him away in a river.<br \/><\/strong><strong><br \/>The child was then found by a charioteer who named him Karna. Karna who listened the whole story cautiously, asked Kunti with tears in his eyes, \u201cWho was she? Take me to her. I want to meet my mother.\u201d An ashamed Kunti bowed down to him and said, \u201cshe\u2019s standing just before you.\u201d Karna\u2019s emotion was heightened. He was both angry and delighted to find his original mother after decades. He asked her, \u201cwhere were you all this time? Did you ever hold me? Did you ever feed me? Did you ever think of me? Did you ever look for me? Did you ever wonder where I might be?\u201d<br \/><\/strong><strong><br \/>Adityan who was still sitting under the white pillar was familiar with these questions. Not because kathakali was saved to his memory but because his life greatly depended on these questions. He lived each day by asking these questions to himself. Adityan, the generous kiddo just like Karna grew up without his mother in an orphanage. But the only difference was that Adityan knew who his mother was from his childhood. Adityan knew that he was an illegitimate son. He knew his mother too couldn\u2019t keep him because she was unmarried when she had him. He knew that his mother was then married. He knew she had other children. Two Sons. More beloved sons- Adityan always believed.<br \/><\/strong><strong><br \/>On the stage Kunti wailed to her son to make a promise. She wanted him to abandon the Mahabharata yudh as he would be fighting his own blood. His younger brothers. The Pandavas. More beloved sons. Karna couldn\u2019t make this promise as he would have to revoke another one made to Duryodhana. Karna always hated Arjuna, the eldest among Pandavas but not the eldest among Kunti\u2019s sons. He was the one who publicly criticized him for being a low charioteer\u2019s son. He hated Arjuna. But on the other hand, he could not refuse his mother. So he made an adjustment. He said, \u201cYudhistira I won\u2019t harm, Bhima I won\u2019t kill, Nakula and Sahadeva I won\u2019t touch. But Arjuna I won\u2019t spare.\u201d<br \/><\/strong><strong><br \/>Adityan put his head between his two folded knees and sat there. He remembered how his mother used to ignore him in public but would shower all her love when she came to orphanage to Please stop doingvisit him. He remembered her beautiful smile. The most beautiful smile he thought. But Adityan never talked to her. Not a single time. Because he always hated her for making him live a lone life. One without anyone to look after.<br \/><\/strong><strong><br \/>Adityan remembered the last time she came to visit. She had said, \u201cAdi, you are a smart young boy. Always remember I love you in same way I love your younger brothers. Please talk to me for once.\u201d Just like every other time, Adityan ignored her. And then days later he came to know he would never be able to talk to her or for that matter never see her.

The day had kicked off with a heated argument with my girlfriend. It wouldn&#8217;t have got worse until when my director fired me from the most-promising project of my company.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; margin: 0cm 0cm 10.0pt 0cm;\">To catch home early, I chose the shortcut to Gandhi Marg, which paved its way through a dreary street. After driving for a mile, unexpectedly a young man, standing by the road waved his hand for a lift. He stood beside his luxurious car, looking out for help. I wished to avoid him but I was pleased by his wince. Knocking at my window pane he said, &#8220;Sir, would you please drop me to our apartment? I know, we are neighbours. My car broke down and I have been waiting here for an hour.&#8221; I couldn&#8217;t recall him as my neighbour, but I couldn&#8217;t turn him down.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; margin: 0cm 0cm 10.0pt 0cm;\">In no time, he got into my car and we drove off.\u00a0 He was zealous like a college boy, with a bright smile on his face.\u00a0 To strike up a conversation, I asked his name. \u201cSiddharth\u201d, he replied with a smile. \u201cWhat! Are you serious? That used to be my pen name under which my articles were published in my University Tabloid&#8221;, I almost shouted. &#8220;Sir, it took no time for me to know that you are a DDUian. I have read your poems. In fact, Sir I was your super junior at DDU Connect&#8221;, he replied. Before I could ask him about his batch, my mobile phone interrupted our conversation. It was my Dad. Declining the call, I said, \u201cActually I don\u2019t trust-\u201d; but he cut me short, \u201cSir, before you instil your trust in me, I would suggest you talk to your dad. It could be something important\u201d. \u201cNothing important\u201d, I continued, \u201che may just want to know if I am on my way home, or not\u201d. \u201cJust call him up\u201d, he said. Parking the car by the roadside, I called my dad. To my surprise, my dad wanted my account details for an important transaction.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; margin: 0cm 0cm 10.0pt 0cm;\">After messaging the details, we proceeded to our destination. The invincible wall of an individual with this stranger took no time to disappear. From his conversation, he appeared to be a man who was not under any stress and looked carefree of any commitments in life. I asked, \u201cSo, are you an engineer?\u201d\u00a0 \u201cI am a writer\u201d, he said curtly.\u00a0 His replies to my queries by now had left me in shock. \u201cThen how do you maintain your lifestyle?\u201d I asked with a smile. He smiled back. I said, \u201cBrother, for a stable life one needs a occupation. However, it drains away your energy and robs all the carefree pleasures of life, and, those adventures of youth too\u201d. \u201cSir, wasn&#8217;t it your own choice to enjoy the life of an engineer? As we grow up, we complicate the simple aspects of our life. In the wee hours as the weather chills, you close the windows to keep the cold outside whereas a ship caught in the storm, ties up its sails high to transcend new shores of opportunities&#8221;, he said.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; margin: 0cm 0cm 10.0pt 0cm;\">While I was parking my car, I offered him to be my guest. We got into the lift. Thankfully, our watchman had held it open for us.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; margin: 0cm 0cm 10.0pt 0cm;\">Sitting on the sofa, we got into a discussion on the problems faced by a common man in life over a glass of wine. When I told him about the argument with my girlfriend, he asked for my mobile. I was hesitant but couldn&#8217;t turn him down. Rather than a text message, he sent a flash message to her. I was set aback by his gesture, but I pretended not to rebel at the moment. To my surprise, I got an instant reply which read: &#8216;Dear, I love you and I&#8217;m always there for you. Have a good night.&#8217; For a moment, I felt that his presence was a healing gel over my wounds. He quoted an episode from his novel &#8216;Stay by Me&#8217;. For a moment, I felt like I had read it somewhere but I couldn&#8217;t recall as each sip of wine was weighing upon me. I did not know when I passed out.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; margin: 0cm 0cm 10.0pt 0cm;\">Next morning, the galling ring of the doorbell woke me up. I was amazed to find myself on my bed and wondered how I bid farewell to the stranger. As I opened the door, I found the watchman with a pile of bills. To know about the stranger, I asked, \u201cHey, do you know on which floor that man lives; one who was with me last night?\u201d \u201cYou were all alone Sahib\u201d, he replied timidly. Then he turned around to ask, \u201cAre you alright, Sahib?\u201d I just nodded my head. Closing the door, I rushed to my laptop and checked the CCTV footage of the camera at my doorstep.

Last year, I was in New York working with the FBI investigating the cases of violence taking a toll over women and children. I was off-duty on one of the Wednesday, 23rd of June. According to the legend, all the descendants of the arctic club have to meet annually to discuss their insecurities and carry forward the tradition for it will strengthen the ultimate bond of friendship. All our family members obeyed it. It was a game nonetheless, of our soi-disant insecurities; only to be laughed at. So my friends- Apollo and Harper, and I were supposed to meet in Philadelphia. The tradition went ignored in the two years past the last year because of our jobs. On the given day, I was driving in my car. It was just as one would wish a road trip to be. Loud metal rock blared out through the partially open windows. In the back of my mind, I was revisiting the old memories of our meetings in all these years. I remembered subconsciously that one of Apollo&#8217;s insecurities, when he was in mid-school was &#8216;pineapple on pizza&#8217;. He thought he was disgusted by the mere thought of it and could taste neither in their true form. I found myself giggling over such ostentatious ideas before my eyes caught hold of the sight of a man. I pulled over to the left side, where he was standing holding a briefcase, to take a better glance at him.</p><p><br />I peeked through the window. The man, he appeared to be in his 60s; detailed lines traced his forehead, eyes that propagated anxiety sat in loose orbs of skin and a trimmed beard that spanned from one earlobe to the other. He said he was grateful that I stopped to his side but he was also greatly distressed and wanted a ride. Something about him compelled me to offer him a ride. He sat on the front seat and we drove off. He said his daughter who is a journalist is being held captive by a group of Iraqi men and that he has to stop them before they do anything to her. We didn&#8217;t talk the whole time. He led me to a place in the nook of the city, which was nowhere near to my destination. I told him that I am an agent and that I could help rescue his daughter. He agreed and stepped out of the car. The place looked exactly like one, where one would expect the abduction to have taken place. I stepped out of the car only to find a small hut white-washed out-and-out. I turned around to ask him how he had known about this place only to find that he had vanished. I walked straight into the hut. Except for the entry door, there was no other way out. Searching for some cue I discovered a trapdoor which when opened led underground through a staircase. I descended the stairs. There was sheer darkness and I had to feel the stairs with my toes to step further. I couldn&#8217;t judge where I was going or whence I came. After a moderate scuffle, the stairs stopped and stretched into a wide floor. My right foot stumbled onto something hard; I drew out a gun adroit and stood in the &#8216;hasty sling&#8217; position pointing at the floor. I poked at it with my foot and realized that it was an immobile thing; wishing I had my phone with myself to turn on the flashlight. Suddenly the room lit up. I figured it was a jacket and thought it could help prevent attacks, so I swiftly put it on. A voice broke the stillness. It was the man; his voice, husky yet monotonous. He spoke creepily this time though. Laughing scornfully as he spoke, &#8220;Welcome.. my seven wonders. You have all entered the deadliest of my labyrinths. There is only one way out. Find it and you escape safe or..&#8221; pausing to laugh mockingly. He continued, &#8220;kill each one of you and I let you go. The jacket that you all are wearing has got nails on the insides that penetrate deeper into your body every hour that goes by. You have 24 hours.” and his voice faded. I was in the insecurity room, this time though, a real one! I ran straight ahead. The more I ran, the more I was lost. I couldn&#8217;t figure out why this was happening to me. An hour had passed by, I looked in my watch. I felt the jacket tighten. I could feel something pinching my abdomen. I burst into tears and suddenly I heard a gunshot. It dawned on me that I was going to die. Maybe that was the only way; I started running along the paths that could perhaps lead me to someone, but everything was in vain. With every passing hour, the jacket pierced into my body. By the 7th hour, blood began spurting out of my body like a fountain. I had lost all hope. I heard gunshots in the background. 10 hours passed by and blood kept rushing out of my body. I fell unconscious. My partially open eyes suddenly saw someone standing in front of me. It was a girl. She wasn&#8217;t wearing any jacket, how lucky she was, thought I. &#8220;Wait! She is a kid.&#8221; I exclaimed in shock. &#8220;I should save her&#8221;, thought my agent mind. On the other hand, human instinct was saying something else. My trembling hand reached out for the gun. I shot her. The walls rose open, the jacket ceased to contract.</p></div>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t</section>\n\t\t\t\t<section class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-c4a3b94 elementor-section-boxed elementor-section-height-default elementor-section-height-default elementor-section elementor-top-section\" data-id=\"c4a3b94\" data-element_type=\"section\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-container elementor-column-gap-default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-row\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"aux-parallax-section elementor-element elementor-element-14e3287 elementor-column elementor-col-100 elementor-top-column\" data-id=\"14e3287\" data-element_type=\"column\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-column-wrap  elementor-element-populated\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-wrap\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-5791be0 elementor-author-box--layout-image-left elementor-author-box--align-left elementor-widget elementor-widget-author-box\" data-id=\"5791be0\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"author-box.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-author-box\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div  class=\"elementor-author-box__avatar\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"https://dduconnect.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/SNIGDHA-300x300.jpg\" alt=\"Snigdha Lokre\">\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-author-box__text\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div >\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3 class=\"elementor-author-box__name\">Snigdha Lokre</h3>\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-author-box__bio\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>EC 4th SEM </p>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t</section>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t",

One could hear the clanking noise of the windows of a room on the topmost floor of a skyscraper even on the roads of a market full of bustle. I was sitting in one of the rooms on 7th floor on one of the two single sitting sofas made of pure leather through which ran long cracks erupting with stories of sufferers of all ages. In front of me sat Mrs Ava, my psychotherapist, in a plain room with white-washed walls on a rocking chair that made long periodical creaks to the rhythm of which I recounted to her the ordeals of my recent nightmare. \u201cI have a strong feeling Ava, the dream meant something. You need to tell me what it could lead to. I have thought about it almost a thousand times; the death camps, piles of dead people, gas chambers, people in the military uniform&#8230;\u201d, I said scratching my head desperately. \u201cArgh, I can\u2019t seem to find the link!\u201d, I grunted. Well, Ava knew exactly what the dream meant. She had known the suffering I had gone through but she didn\u2019t want it to happen to me again. \u201cIt\u2019s alright Nial, I suggest you do not stress your brain so much. It\u2019s just a dream.\u201d, she comforted. She understood that it was easier to treat patients who were conscious of their memories than it was to treat those who had lost them.\u00a0<\/p><p>The following day when I was walking my way back to Ava\u2019s therapy class, a piece of paper came floating by and landed on the road and I stepped on it subconsciously. I stepped back and bent to pick up the paper and looked at it. It seemed like a torn piece of a document that perhaps contained names of some people. It looked like it was torn from the middle-top portion of the document which read, \u2018The Schindler\u2019s List\u2019. \u201cSchindler!\u201d, I gasped. \u201cThe name, I have heard it before.\u201d, I recited in the back of my mind. Memories flashed. I was taken aback. They were similar to the ones I had seen in my dreams. Terrified, I went and sat on the bench to my right under an oak tree and began contemplating over the possibility of the link between this mere piece of paper and the dream of the previous night. In an attempt to analyse the faded letters, I found an address and a telephone number, \u201c182, Cross Street\u201d and \u201c7398\u201d. Thinking that it belonged to some play called \u2018The Schindler\u2019s List\u2019, I thought I could probably find the link between the various elements of my dream. I stood up and went straight into the telephone booth and dialled \u20187&#8211;3&#8211;9&#8211;8&#8242; on the swiss rotary telephone and waited. \u201cHello?..\u201d, I spoke trembling. \u201cThey are coming for you.\u201d, a voice from the other side cut me short. \u201cWhat?\u201d, I replied. The phone got disconnected. I shrunk and looked around in horror. Unknown, unvisited memories kept flashing back and forth through my mind. I didn\u2019t know what was happening. I began to sweat, hard. I stumbled on the sidewall of the booth. The phrase of the call receiver, it reverberated in my mind; growing in magnitude. It was straining my mind. It drained out all my energy and I let out a deep growl. Ah, there it was! \u201cOskar Schindler. The man who saved me and hundreds of others from the inhumane tortures of the Nazis. He had made the Schindler\u2019s list. It had carried my family\u2019s name and mine too.\u201d, I realised. I slammed the door open and without a thought ran like a sheep; terrified. It was there; all the torture, as if it happened yesterday. I could recall people being killed in gas chambers and being taken to death camps. I didn\u2019t know where I was going, but I ran to save my family- my parents and my siblings. \u201cHe said, they were coming. They are going to kill us. I am going to have to save mom, dad and Anna, Joseph and Hans.\u201d, I kept saying to myself on loop. I ran like a coward. I remember that day, the one when they came searching for my family. My mom, whispering from afar, where she and others hid, indicating to me to stay hidden behind the wide pole while they searched in our homes.<\/p><p>I took the first train to Auschwitz. I don\u2019t remember if I have ever visited the place after the tragedy and I didn\u2019t want to go back. But there was no choice. I somehow reached the place where the mass genocide had taken place. Upon reaching, my eyes couldn\u2019t behold what they saw. A massive base of the German military. It was being restored and so was the evil. Turning my face to the south-east, I could see a small ghetto with piles of dead bodies. There lay my family. Not my mom, dad and siblings. But my wife and children. \u201cI just cannot take it anymore. I have lost all my family.\u201d, I dropped down and cried to myself. The next thing I knew, my body unfolded and straightened and I was running towards the armed guards.

I gulped down the sputum down my throat, tried to get up and figure out where I was. People were looking at me. Those eyes were aberrant to me, yet customary for them.<\/p><p>&#8220;Here. Take my hand.&#8221; a slightly older man offered his hand to me. &#8220;I don&#8217;t remember anything.&#8221; was the first thing I said and he smiled. At first he seemed sly to me, but as it turned out, he was quite a generous old man. He also explained to me the meaning of this place and the meaning of us all being here. Apparently, this was a place where people were sent after they die. However, it wasn&#8217;t heaven or hell, it was a place for souls with questions. People knew they&#8217;re dead but don&#8217;t remember what caused it. But, do I have any questions?<\/p><p>Jos\u00e9, as he said his name was, guided me through the place and also briefed me about all the people who greeted me. They were nice to me except for one woman. I sure didn&#8217;t know who she was and I thought she doesn&#8217;t either, but she looked at me with ire and left. I asked Jos\u00e9 what was wrong with her, to which he answered &#8220;She&#8217;s the odd one&#8221; referring to her mental condition. Maybe I&#8217;ll talk to her someday. I told myself.<\/p><p>Five days had passed and I still didn&#8217;t remember my name. Why? I muttered to myself while walking towards a group of people. The place wasn&#8217;t so bad. It was huge and every evening we had this gathering where everyone shared whatever they wanted to. &#8220;Girl!&#8221; exclaimed one of the old men. &#8220;Did you recall your name yet?&#8221; he asked with amusement. Flustered, I tucked a lock of hair behind my ear and shook my head. &#8220;Mm-Maya&#8221; said someone from the crowd. People made a way to disclose the person who spoke. It was Amy, the odd one. &#8220;What?&#8221; I asked curiously. &#8220;Mm-Maya heh-h&#8221; she repeated. Everyone looked at her intrigued. But Amy ravingly, just left the place. Everyone thought this was just an Amy-incident but I didn&#8217;t feel so. She had been acting weird with me since the day she saw me I don&#8217;t know why. I followed her and called out her name. She wouldn&#8217;t stop until I grabbed ahold of her.<\/p><p>&#8220;Amy do you know my name?&#8221; I asked. &#8220;Maya&#8221; she laughed. &#8220;What do you know about me?&#8221; She didn&#8217;t answer and continued laughing. &#8220;Tell me!&#8221; I asked demandingly. &#8220;You killed me!&#8221; she shouted with amusement and started to leave the spot.<\/p><p>&#8220;What are you talking about? How do you know that?&#8221; I demanded for an answer. &#8220;You came to my place and suffocated me with a carry bag hehe&#8221; she answered. She acted as if all this was a joke. &#8220;You&#8217;re mad and I&#8217;m going.&#8221; I started walking towards the opposite direction. &#8220;You had been taking pills before killing me to forget what happened. L-look at your sk-skin, isn&#8217;t it pale?&#8221; she told me. I paused and orderly looked at my hands. They were pale. But maybe she was just bluffing. Why would I take beta blockers before actually killing her? Wouldn&#8217;t it be logical that I took them after I committed the crime? And for all the sake, how did she even know me? Yes, she&#8217;s just bluffing. I fastened away from her.<\/p><p>&#8220;D-don&#8217;t you want to know who killed your baby?&#8221;<\/p><p>Startled, I looked at her. She paused for a brief moment and shouted &#8220;I did!&#8221; A tear left my eye. I had a baby? Suddenly everything inside me felt callous. &#8220;What did you do? Tell me what you did. Please!&#8221; I cried. I wanted to annihilate the woman&#8217;s existence. She just looked at me with a bulwark on, while tears rolled down me cheeks until I became physically unable to maintain my posture.<\/p><p>&#8220;I ran my c-car over your boy because I didn&#8217;t l-like him being with you.&#8221; she said blatantly. &#8220;You knew I did it but people won&#8217;t listen. You turned into a fleabag and started taking pills to forget. Monday night you came to m-my place and started a c- about your boy&#8217;s death. Then you killed me.&#8221; She blankly stated all of this as if nothing mattered.<\/p><p>&#8220;Why don&#8217;t I remember my past then? Like all the other people here?&#8221; I asked. &#8220;Don&#8217;t you get it? You continued taking pills. It makes you forget things! You probably had no memory when you died.&#8221; I tried to put the pieces together. Everything made sense now. &#8220;He didn&#8217;t deserve to live. Like my boy Sage. No boy deserves to live. Like my boy Sage.&#8221; She chanted these line again and again. I felt, empty.<\/p><p>&#8220;He is here you know? Your boy.&#8221; I gazed at her with my now crimson eyes waiting for her to say more. &#8220;And I really really like it that he doesn&#8217;t remember you yet. That I recognize him everyday and you can&#8217;t. It really pleases me.&#8221; &#8220;Please tell me where he is.&#8221; I cried. &#8220;What is it worth? Lincoln won&#8217;t even recognize you!&#8221; she stated.<\/p><p>&#8220;Lincoln..&#8221; I huffed. A sudden gush of elation ran through me. &#8220;Lincoln! Lincoln!&#8221; I shouted. I looked at every boy&#8217;s face, tried to recall anything at all. &#8220;Lincoln!&#8221; I didn&#8217;t stop. He was here. I felt like what the tides would feel when the full moon accompanied. I have to find him. &#8220;Lincoln!&#8221;<\/p><p>&#8220;M-mom?&#8221; A sweet voice followed my calling. It was an odd one.<\/p><\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/section>\n\t\t\t\t<section class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-0a8bd0a elementor-section-boxed elementor-section-height-default elementor-section-height-default elementor-section elementor-top-section\" data-id=\"0a8bd0a\" data-element_type=\"section\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-container elementor-column-gap-default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-row\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"aux-parallax-section elementor-element elementor-element-44e7c7e elementor-column elementor-col-100 elementor-top-column\" data-id=\"44e7c7e\" data-element_type=\"column\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-column-wrap  elementor-element-populated\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-wrap\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-6c583e2 elementor-author-box--layout-image-left elementor-author-box--align-left elementor-widget elementor-widget-author-box\" data-id=\"6c583e2\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"author-box.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-author-box\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div  class=\"elementor-author-box__avatar\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"https:\/\/dduconnect.in\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/12\/icon-login-3.jpg-300x300.png\" alt=\"Priya Rathod\">\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-author-box__text\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div >\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3 class=\"elementor-author-box__name\">Priya Rathod<\/h3>\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-author-box__bio\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>IT 4th SEM <\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/section>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t",

There are a pile of clothes sitting across me since last week. I can smell a certain foul smell around me which certainly must be due to my irregular shower schedule. I can feel my roommate&#8217;s disapproving glares burning on my back. The afternoon sunshine forces me to shut my eyes close. I am just about to fall back into another slumber when her face comes in front of my mind&#8217;s eye. The little energy I had gained since my last meal slowly fades away. I force myself to fall asleep harder, promising to not get up until all my problems have solved themselves. After an hour of unfulfilling sleep, I push myself up and into my clammy little washroom. The mirror greets me with her face, I splash cold water on my face trying to rub her mark off of me but once again her tired, sad, lifeless eyes stare back at me. I try to remember since when she started affecting me so much. I remember briefly meeting her on lonely Saturdays and how she was there for me when my trips back to home were canceled at last minute or how she lent her shoulder to try on during my fallouts with friends.<\/p><p>Oh, how na\u00efve I was to fall for her pretenses. She came in my life with the tag as &#8220;self-care&#8221; and ended up being like a parasite, sucking the life out of my soul. Maybe it was her scared eyes or love deprived heart that pulled me towards her. Or it could even be how well she knew and understood me. Of course, she would know me inside out, she was me after all, granted she was the sadder version of me but still me. During the start of our relationship, she would just meet me occasionally, and then I started noticing her being on my tail whenever I was out having fun. She didn\u2019t object much when I laughed at my friends\u2019 joke or during a fun movie but she would murmur to me how my laugh resembles a pig\u2019s snort and how I look like an ugly duckling among my friends. Her disapproval made me unable to even smile in front of others. Soon the invisible girl took the reins of my life and asked me to take a backseat.<\/p><p>I started bunking lectures and sleeping in on account of minor inconveniences. It old myself it was only because I was tired and won\u2019t be able to study in class with my headache. But soon those occasional bunks became frequent. I slept for 10hr sat a stretch almost every night but not ones in the morning did I ever feel refreshed. I got ready the same every day, not forgetting my hygiene once but my face had a strange sort of dullness. I couldn\u2019t understand what was taught in lectures and attended labs just for the sake of attendance.<\/p><p>The wrecked girl had started it all, smiling slyly in my shadow when I saw my disheartening internal results. \u201cStop it!\u201d my best friend had shouted at me. She had come to console me and I had really tried to listen but I could see her floating behind my friend. \u201cStop with those \u2018lost eyes\u2019 of yours,\u201d she said exasperated, \u201cthis has been going on for way to long. You hardly talk and on those rare occasions when you do, you won\u2019t look us in the eye. Whatever it is you are going through needs to stop.\u201d<\/p><p>That cold evening after I promised my friend I would med my ways, I called her. She wasn\u2019t someone who came on being called, she was the queen of her own mind. But there must have been something in my tone that she showed up. \u201cWho are you and why wouldn\u2019t you leave me alone.\u201d That was the day when she told me her name for the first time. She called herself depression. I was unable to accept the fact that I had been chilling out with depression since the past few weeks. The gravity of the situation finally hit me and I begged her to move out of my life and never show her face again. She simply laughed at my face and told me how I wouldn\u2019t survive without her. She wasn\u2019t wrong but I was willing to take the risk. \u201cYou are worthless\u201d, she told me. I lashed out at depression begging her through my blurred vision to leave me. But she stood her ground. Not moving an inch. \u201cPlease, I don\u2019t want this life\u201d, I cried. \u201cThen take it.\u201d She smirked. I gasped. After a few hours of pointless name-calling, I gave up. Like always.<\/p><p>It has been a whole week since that episode, and I have never felt so drained of energy in my whole life. But I haven&#8217;t completely given up yet. I am still adamant about not being depressed. I fall back on my unmade bed and pick up my barely charged phone and call my parents. Each passing ring shrinks my will power. \u201cHi, beta\u201d, those two words are enough for me to break down. In between my muffled sobs, I ask my parents to save me from her.<\/p><\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/section>\n\t\t\t\t<section class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-f061310 elementor-section-boxed elementor-section-height-default elementor-section-height-default elementor-section elementor-top-section\" data-id=\"f061310\" data-element_type=\"section\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-container elementor-column-gap-default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-row\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"aux-parallax-section elementor-element elementor-element-848b797 elementor-column elementor-col-100 elementor-top-column\" data-id=\"848b797\" data-element_type=\"column\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-column-wrap  elementor-element-populated\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-wrap\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-e5f0222 elementor-author-box--layout-image-left elementor-author-box--align-left elementor-widget elementor-widget-author-box\" data-id=\"e5f0222\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"author-box.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-author-box\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div  class=\"elementor-author-box__avatar\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"https:\/\/dduconnect.in\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/12\/DIVYESHREE-500x500-300x300.jpg\" alt=\"Divyashree Iyer\">\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-author-box__text\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div >\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3 class=\"elementor-author-box__name\">Divyashree Iyer<\/h3>\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-author-box__bio\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>IT, 4th Sem.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/section>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t",

It was his friend, Jack who broke the tragic news in the subtlest way possible, dropping hints and letting him uncover the story. His stepfather Mr Connor Ryan had died a few hours ago, in an accident amongst several others. It was so brutal that the incident was in the face of every news channel headline. Jack took his time to confirm the accuracy of the news before delivering it. But no matter how many times he would ask or check the list of the dead people, Robin\u2019s stepfather was still there on the list.<br \/>Robin\u2019s face was utterly blank, devoid of any emotions. A tear dropped from his left eye, the only indication of the abyss of grief he was falling into. When he was out of the eye of the storm of sorrow, he stood up and went to the balcony, shutting the door behind him, locking himself alone. There was a chair facing the brisk wind. Contemplating the series of events that had followed a few minutes ago, he slowly sank into the seat. The physical exhaustion that seemed to come from the grief of the loss was slowly sinking into his bones. He tried to focus on his surroundings to get out of the abyss, even so temporarily. The leaves were changing its colour from warm green to ochre-brown indicating change and thus the arrival of autumn. On the streets below, a toddler was being strolled by his grandpa. The birds were seen to be feeding their babies. No matter where he looked or shifted his focus, he could only see the unavoidable transition of life-forms from life to death, whether it may be the faintest notes he could hear someone hitting far away or the bright sun in the sky that will eventually be replaced by the moon.<br \/>Head thrown on the cushion of the chair, body pretty much motionless, and ethereal self still falling into the abyss, his dead eyes continued to look towards the sky. Something was coming to him. He was too engrossed in his thoughts that until a cold wave hit him hard, he didn&#8217;t realize it. He could not quite wrap his mind around it, it was too subtle. But, the presence was there.<br \/>Now, his heart-beats started changing its wave as the realization started hitting him quite so ever faintly and slowly, becoming a little strong on every hit. He was trying to fight it with all his might which had been rendered useless due to the emotional blow received from what seems like days ago, but to no avail. While he let himself be consumed by it, his heart said something that was unknown to him, what he had thought only came in his dreams- \u201cfreedom\u201d. He couldn\u2019t believe it until those lips of his parted and he heard the vocal cord of his throat made the same voice. The dead eyes were slowly gaining life, or to say an entirely new life. He did not consider asking himself if the feeling of pure joy might be atrocious. What he was seeing was only his free life and nothing else. He did not hate him. Although, sometimes he was treated in a biased manner by his stepfather as compared to his step-siblings. He had forgotten about his stepfather\u2019s anger issues, how he\u2019d let it out on him and how pure cruel he was at times. Still, he loved him. Also, now it doesn\u2019t matter. He\u2019d found something more than love itself- freedom.<br \/>The train of his thoughts was stopped when his friend called him from the other side of the door. His friend was worried that he might never come out of the abyss of darkness. But he was soaring in the limitless sky that he had just discovered.<br \/>He opened the door to his friend\u2019s importunities. He clasped his shoulders and descended the stairs. A click sound came from the door. A man in his early 40s entered the room. It was Connor, and he was perfectly well, maybe a little travel-soiled but far from harm\u2019s way. He didn\u2019t even know about any such accident where he\u2019d supposedly met his death, he was far from it. Jack justified his immature decision, thinking someone must have made a typo in Connor\u2019s name which was not very uncommon. Just then, Jack felt the hands on his shoulders slipping away. Alas, he was an instant too late to realize. Connor stood amazed at the sight of Robin\u2019s falling body and his friend trying to catch him.<br \/>When the doctors came, they said that Robin had died of heart disease- of a joy that kills.<\/p><\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/section>\n\t\t\t\t<section class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-1254f35 elementor-section-boxed elementor-section-height-default elementor-section-height-default elementor-section elementor-top-section\" data-id=\"1254f35\" data-element_type=\"section\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-container elementor-column-gap-default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-row\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"aux-parallax-section elementor-element elementor-element-e75be96 elementor-column elementor-col-100 elementor-top-column\" data-id=\"e75be96\" data-element_type=\"column\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-column-wrap  elementor-element-populated\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-wrap\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-5060a86 elementor-author-box--layout-image-left elementor-author-box--align-left elementor-widget elementor-widget-author-box\" data-id=\"5060a86\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"author-box.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-author-box\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div  class=\"elementor-author-box__avatar\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"https:\/\/dduconnect.in\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/11\/UTSAV-300x300.jpeg\" alt=\"Utsav Parmar\">\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-author-box__text\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div >\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3 class=\"elementor-author-box__name\">Utsav Parmar<\/h3>\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-author-box__bio\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>CE, 5th Sem.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/section>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t",

I would gaze at the sky, trying to spot constellations and imagine the object it portrayed by joining the dots. Orion was the easiest one. Although, I didn\u2019t stay transfixed for hours as they so romantically put it. It did pique my curiosity. And now here I am, 1300 light years away in the middle of the same Orion, on the first ever space civilisation setup by humans. Maybe, someone is looking at us from the Earth.\u201d, Andrews said and waved his hand at the sky.<\/p><div><p>\u00a0<\/p><div>\u201cIt sounds magnanimous sir!\u201d, ANNE replied.<\/div><p>\u00a0<\/p><div>It had been 100 days since the inception of Andrea- a second home to humans. Andrea wasn\u2019t the Earth like planet that we found and inhabited. It was a huge ring structure built around a spinning blackhole using metals extracted from nearby exoplanets. Andrea was built at just the right distance and it rotated with just the right speed to counterbalance black hole\u2019s pull and gravity was as good as that on the Earth. They threaded superconducting coils through black hole\u2019s horizon to tap the electricity to surface of Andrea, just like a dynamo. And it would be eons before it ran out of power.<\/div><p>\u00a0<\/p><div>\u201cSir, I think We should head back to the station. Such long exposures may cause cellular mutations inside your body.\u201d, ANNE said. Andrews never had second thoughts to what ANNE said because he believed it was incorruptible as it wasn\u2019t a human in first place; a robot. They got into the aircraft and reached a tiny cubicle where there was a helipad marked X. Once the aircraft landed there, helipad started descending slowly and inside lay a beautiful city- ellipsoidal edifices and lakes forming perfect circles scattered amidst labyrinth of flora and fauna. Andrews manoeuvred his aircraft to his lab.<\/div><p>\u00a0<\/p><div>Andrews was the chief engineer of this project Andrea. A project this daunting and so massive had never been done before. Today, they were going to take another great leap. They were going to look inside the black hole and try to find out the missing pieces to the \u2018Theory of Everything\u2019 which If successful could even pave the way to constructing a Time Machine. Dr. Michael was harbouring a great expectation from this experiment of peeking inside the black hole. He called it the most ambitious project of his life. Dr. Michael was also at helm of project Andrea. He was a prodigy; a brilliant mathematician and a leading theoretical physicist of 24th century. He took Einstein\u2019s legacy a step further and reconciled Quantum mechanics with General relativity. If it weren\u2019t for him, Andrea would have fallen back by several millennia, for he decoded the science behind wormholes and assisted in developing the technology to create a wormhole from solar system to Orion Nebula, a tunnel through hyperspace which reduced the distance of 1300 light years to about 200 million kilometres. He was indeed a man ahead of his time.<\/div><p>\u00a0<\/p><div>Just hours before the experiment, Andrews had bitter argument with him. He was ominous.<\/div><p>\u00a0<\/p><div>\u201cDr. Michael, I have some reservations about this experiment of yours. I think we shouldn\u2019t experiment with these mystic particles- primordial blackholes, something that we don\u2019t yet understand fully.\u201d<\/div><p>\u00a0<\/p><div>\u201cCalm down Andrews. Do you understand how fortunate we have been to have had the opportunity to study primordial blackholes- miniscule particles which were supposedly originated during the origin of universe and are perhaps the miniature models of the black hole we\u2019ll try to probe today. If we never try how will we ever know anything.\u201d<\/div><p>\u00a0<\/p><div>\u201cBut sir, do you understand the gravity of the possible consequences of the experiment? It may result into a catastrophic series of events which will jeopardise Andrea and even result into total destruction of life system that we\u2019ve built here. Sir, I entreat you to abort this experiment.\u201d<\/div><p>\u00a0<\/p><div>\u201cI have never been wrong, and I don\u2019t see why that should change. Once I have accomplished this, I will have surpassed all the greats ever (sighs). Just take a leap of faith with me, Andrews.\u201d<\/div><p>\u00a0<\/p><div>Dr. Michael scoffed and stormed out of the room. Andrews knew that Doctor had gone past the point of no return.<\/div><p>\u00a0<\/p><div>\u201cT-30 seconds to launch. All systems are fully functional and responsive.\u201d The entire team of Dr. Michael held their breath as they watched ANNE start descend towards the black hole. It carried a capsule containing primordial black hole in a perfect vacuum, isolated from all disturbances. ANNE\u2019s signals received at Andrea began experiencing red shift, turning into longer and longer wavelengths as it descended further down, which was as expected. ANNE started revolving in orbit just outside event horizon, a region beyond which even light cannot escape hole\u2019s pull.<\/div><p>\u00a0<\/p><div>\u201cSir, there\u2019s some erratic activity in our orbit. Detection of gravitational waves and rise in temperatures. Thrust power requirement is greater than the calculated value.\u201d, ANNE transmitted message to Andrea. Everyone started sweating profusely when they heard this, except Dr. Michael. \u201cKeep sending the data ANNE.\u201d, he replied.<\/div><p>\u00a0<\/p><div>Suddenly, capsule broke open and distorted black mass emancipated itself. Primordial Blackhole began growing at a rapid rate and soon turned into a colossal monster.<\/div><p>\u00a0<\/p><div>All hell broke loose at Andrea. The primordial black hole had begun engulfing the other black hole and its enormous pull would soon spaghettify Andrea. Ambition and vanity had clouded Dr. Michael\u2019s judgement and entire humanity had to pay the price. Andrews immediately initiated evacuation. They had spacecrafts which could be mobilised in very short time. Dr. Michael seated paralysed with horror whilst others began leaving hastily. He had sunk into abyss of regret and remorse. Andrews had to carry the frozen Doctor to the spacecraft. He watched from space Andrea disintegrate and amalgamate with stars lying inside the blackhole.<\/div><\/div><\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/section>\n\t\t\t\t<section class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-584eb8c elementor-section-boxed elementor-section-height-default elementor-section-height-default elementor-section elementor-top-section\" data-id=\"584eb8c\" data-element_type=\"section\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-container elementor-column-gap-default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-row\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"aux-parallax-section elementor-element elementor-element-c10ab68 elementor-column elementor-col-100 elementor-top-column\" data-id=\"c10ab68\" data-element_type=\"column\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-column-wrap\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-wrap\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/section>\n\t\t\t\t<section class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-0f23973 elementor-section-boxed elementor-section-height-default elementor-section-height-default elementor-section elementor-top-section\" data-id=\"0f23973\" data-element_type=\"section\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-container elementor-column-gap-default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-row\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"aux-parallax-section elementor-element elementor-element-32616ee elementor-column elementor-col-100 elementor-top-column\" data-id=\"32616ee\" data-element_type=\"column\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-column-wrap  elementor-element-populated\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-wrap\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-bc3a670 elementor-widget elementor-widget-author-box\" data-id=\"bc3a670\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"author-box.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-author-box\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div  class=\"elementor-author-box__avatar\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"https:\/\/dduconnect.in\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/11\/PARTH-M-300x300.jpeg\" alt=\"Parth Mamtora\">\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-author-box__text\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div >\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"elementor-author-box__name\">Parth Mamtora<\/h4>\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-author-box__bio\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>MH, 6th Sem.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/section>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t",

I loved spending holidays at my grandmother\u2019s. It was the love that she showered on me that made me wanting to visit her. Also, her neighborhood had become so accepting and amiable that when it was the time to part from her for the hostel again, it made my eyes fill with tears of love. &#8211; Lying on the hospital bed, I try to spill the memories into my diary. My handwriting has never been worse. With every moment passing, I comprehend sentence after sentence and wonder why I did not write earlier. It has not been more than seven hours that I woke up from the prolonged unconsciousness of five long years. Seldom does my brain help me track memories down to the root, but today it is different. It is almost as if it wants me to recollect everything till the point I failed.<\/p><p>It was the 23rd of December, five years back. Like every year, I was at my grandmother&#8217;s. It was very unusual of me to wake up early in the morning for exercise. But, that day had something different in store for me. I set out at seven, running along the fence of the garden in my new sneakers. Eight rounds down, tired and resting on a bench while sipping water, I saw a girl on the other side of the road. There was a charm on her face that made me keen to know more about her.<\/p><p>It had been three days and all I had done was stare at her and look away when she would catch a sight of me. Gathering all the courage on the fourth day, I walked up to her and asked, &#8220;Do you mind if I sit here?&#8221; She nodded. Brown eyes, dark, curly hair and a round, fair face. She seemed as serene as the winter morning. We sat on the same bench for ten minutes but I could not utter a word. In an attempt to know\u00a0 her, I had collected some information about her. I came to know that she was my grandmother\u2019s neighbor\u2019s niece who lived in Australia and had come to visit her aunt. After calculating the odds of being able to or not being able to talk to her ever, I decided to initiate. Our talks hardly lasted for five minutes as she always seemed to be in a hurry to reach home.<\/p><p>Not many days had passed, atleast it didn\u2019t seem like they had; and before I managed to have a talk which didn\u2019t end in five minutes, it was time for me to go. I decided to bid her a farewell in a very special way. I woke up early in the morning and reached the garden a few minutes before my usual time. To my surprise, I saw her getting into a car. Maybe she was leaving for Australia. For a moment, I felt like I would never see her again. &#8220;But, will I give up so easily?&#8221;, I thought. With that, I accelerated and ran towards her car. A moment ago she was there, across the road; the next moment everything went black.<\/p><p>Today, it is the 25th of December. I should have been at my grandmother\u2019s. Instead, I am lying on a hospital bed, covered with a boring white sheet. I am told that I was hit by a bus and suffered a serious brain injury. My thoughts aren\u2019t clear but, even in this swirl I can distinctly remember her face, smiling at me. I just want to get out of this room, go to my grandmother&#8217;s neighbor and ask about her. I have lost all hopes and made peace with the fact that not all stories have a happy ending. With that notion, I close my diary and put it in the drawer next to my bed. Just as I shut the drawer, I hear a knock on the door. I see flowers through the glass door and a girl smiling widely at me. I remember that smile. I remember those brown eyes. I ring the bell as an acknowledgement and as the door opens, I feel blood rushing through my face.

Four more soldiers followed them inside. Each of them carried a semi-automatic assault rifle, a short range pistol gun and the badge on their breast pocket read \u2018Sarvatra Izzat O Iqbal.\u2019 In a split second, the soldiers had divided themselves in group of twos and rampaged through the entire house, the next moment a shout was heard; confirming that they had found what they were looking for. Miriam stood numb as soldiers carried away her bother right in front of her eyes. Tariq shot a glance at Miriam as he was walked out; their eyes met and Miriam could sense an appeal of help in her brother\u2019s eyes. However, before Miriam could compose herself to make a tangible reaction, the soldier hit the butt of his assault rifle down Tariq\u2019s back and the whole house trembled with Tariq\u2019s shriek of agony.<\/p><p>This was two years back. The entire village had witnessed this tragic episode and it grieved for Miriam\u2019s loss. Miriam\u2019s own grief had been second to none, everyone who had watched her breakdown were humbled with compassion and felt a certain sensation of ire against Indian army. Miriam\u2019s whole community was an ally to Indian army. They were eyes and ears who could keep watch at unfenced borders of Kashmir valley. They often dwelled their herds of sheep in those greener patches near the Line of Control, an are which often stayed out of army vigil. Bakarwal shepherds had also played a pivotal role during war of 1965 and 1991; informing the army about Pakistani infiltration. However, Tariq\u2019s arrest had breached all the trust that evolved during those years.<\/p><p>Miriam sat on her calves, trying to pray and tranquil her anxious mind but unsuccessful. Today was the most important day of her life. Finally, she stood at the threshold of accomplishing her \u2018Maksad.\u2019 One final step!<\/p><p>Miriam was conduit of Islamic state, a terrorist group in eyes of government and freedom fighters for those like Miriam. She wished to walk the path of \u2018Jihad\u2019 to restore harmony in her motherland. Miriam smirked to herself as she remembered how she overcame every difficulty; the biggest one being eliminating her own brother. Tariq had begun getting suspicious about her. He had seen Miriam pelting stones at army, found out about her receiving \u2018Jihad\u2019 teachings from Chacha Abdul. He tried to preach Miriam about how Kashmir had become a purgatory; a land torn between conflicts of two nations and \u2018Jihad\u2019 was only going to aggravate the situation. He had spoken of article 370 of the constitution of India which granted a special status to their status. How could Miriam\u2019s conscience let her soul stay at peace if she betrayed the nation that offered her so much?<br \/>Miriam had stayed impervious to Tariq\u2019s utterings but felt herself vulnerable. So, she herself tipped off her comrade in army confinement to name Tariq has his accomplice. Thence, Miriam hadn\u2019t looked back and silently kept preparing for this day. The chief Minister was going to arrive in the city to inaugurate the newly formed bridge over river Jhelum. Miriam was going to blow him to pieces and herself too.<\/p><p>It was nearly the time now. She strapped two rolls of fluffy looking plastic explosives at her belly and put on her favourite blue dress over it and a scarlet hijab round her face. She then went to Chacha Abdul\u2019s residence, her mentor in this crusade of hers. He blessed her and gave a rose garland, a parting gift intended for the honourable chief minister.<br \/>Miriam reached the site of inauguration two hours prior to event, yet magnitude of crowd that showed up was massive. She thought it would be quite a spectacle here when she unleashes her fireworks. However, she wasn\u2019t the part of the crowd, she sat ahead of the barricades in VIP zone on those ergonomic sofas. She sat patiently for one hour and though she knew everything was going as planned, her throat was running dry. And then it happened!<\/p><p>There was a tap on Miriam\u2019s shoulders and when she turned back, her whole world toppled down. It was Tariq and behind him were team of commandos. \u201cHow could it be? Was Tariq\u2019s arrest sham? Am I outplayed?\u201d, thoughts running quickly in Miriam\u2019s mind. Instinctively, her hands stretched towards her purse to take out the detonation remote. \u201cIt\u2019s useless! We jammed microwaves too, the spectrum your naughty remote operates on\u201d Tariq said and Miriam frantically kept twitching her remote. She couldn\u2019t make spectacle happen.<\/p><\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/section>\n\t\t\t\t<section class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-5a05c50 elementor-section-boxed elementor-section-height-default elementor-section-height-default elementor-section elementor-top-section\" data-id=\"5a05c50\" data-element_type=\"section\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-container elementor-column-gap-default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-row\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"aux-parallax-section elementor-element elementor-element-b587ecb elementor-column elementor-col-100 elementor-top-column\" data-id=\"b587ecb\" data-element_type=\"column\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-column-wrap  elementor-element-populated\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-wrap\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-e0eae5f elementor-author-box--layout-image-left elementor-author-box--align-left elementor-author-box--image-valign-middle elementor-widget elementor-widget-author-box\" data-id=\"e0eae5f\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"author-box.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-author-box\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div  class=\"elementor-author-box__avatar\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"https:\/\/dduconnect.in\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/11\/PARTH-M-300x300.jpeg\" alt=\"Parth Momtora\">\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-author-box__text\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div >\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3 class=\"elementor-author-box__name\">Parth Momtora<\/h3>\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-author-box__bio\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>MH, 6th Sem.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/section>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t",

Nonchalant yet the most energetic girl, with no friends at all in the hostel, enjoyed her grandfather&#8217;s company every Sunday. It had become an escape from the loneliness of hostel for her. Whenever he arrived, she felt as if her world was getting decorated by the flowers, chocolates, balloons and the happiness her grandpa brought for her. Every walk would become yet another tale of fun and love and embellish the memories of childhood which wouldn&#8217;t have existed without him. Every walk was a tour to their world of imaginations. Being the only family left of hers, her grandfather, Shankar, never let her feel alone. Without speaking to her on the telephone, he couldn&#8217;t sleep peacefully. All his peace was in her comfort. This grandfather-granddaughter duet filled the void of each other&#8217;s life.<br \/>On that day she had waited too long for him to come. It was already dusk, the stars were twinkling in the night and with every passing second, she was becoming more and more impatient. Though the night was cold and chilling, the warmth of her anger shielded her from coming into the grasp of cold. In that chilling night, when the surrounding was serene, and the nocturnal creatures were awake, she saw a bright and thin, a not so tall figure growing at the distance. As the figure was growing larger and larger, she kept becoming perplexed to see that the outline was resembling with her grandfather&#8217;s. Then, she saw his curly grey hairs, dark complexion, white beard jutting out of his chin with a stick in his tender hands and his wobbly walking gait of a toddler who has learned to walk a few days ago. Eventually in the dull lights of street lamp she identified her grandfather in full white kurta and pajama with a heavenly smile on his wrinkled face. She ran barefoot towards him and cuddled him tightly whilst tears rolling down her cheeks. They both were as still as statue for next few minutes and then they sat down. As usual, before beginning their walk, he shared a little piece of chocolate with her. It was customary for Riya to have a chocolate or else she won\u2019t allow Shankar to take her on walk.<br \/>&#8220;So, what are we waiting for?&#8221;<br \/>&#8220;All your patience is exhausted, and I can feel that&#8221;, he laughed gently.<br \/>Without waiting anymore, they began their walk. While they were shivering on their walk, a butterfly with glittering white wings sat on her nose. A little scared yet brave Ria touched its gentle wings very tenderly and then in the empty surroundings, the glimmering butterflies emerged out of nowhere, flying all around them. From heaven to the earth, wherever their eyes went their sight met those colorful butterflies which encircled them. It added the warmth of colors to their cold walk under the black sky. Though that mesmerizing effect lasted for a short time, it aroused a warm sentiment they wouldn\u2019t forget for lifetime. Riya&#8217;s smile spread as wide as it could, and her grandfather was lost in her surreal happiness. They continued their walk and after a few miles they were amidst the woods in a garden besides which a river was flowing. The wind was whistling, the leaves were rumbling, and the water of the river was burbling on the uneven riverbed. Also, the leaves were falling ever so slowly over their heads due to the gentle wind blowing through the mingled branches of trees. They both felt as if that shower of leaves was a warm welcome to this rhythmic place of the nature. She could sense a melody in this noise. She forced Shankar to dance and when they danced, she laughed aloud seeing him dance with such tranquility. It could be clearly seen that the loudness of her laughter was soothing his ears. Following that rhythm, now they were on a plain which was ascending gradually toward the sky. Finally, they reached a land where the branches of the only maple tree in the town were waving with the wind. They lay down there and observed the midnight moon shining brightly over their heads. They talked about their happy and sad moments during that week. Suddenly, Shankar rose and soared toward the sky into the darkness, behind the moon, where the land of heaven was hidden and became a star which twinkled brighter than every other star in the sky.<\/p><\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/section>\n\t\t\t\t<section class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-3a7b2f7 elementor-section-boxed elementor-section-height-default elementor-section-height-default elementor-section elementor-top-section\" data-id=\"3a7b2f7\" data-element_type=\"section\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-container elementor-column-gap-default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-row\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"aux-parallax-section elementor-element elementor-element-185a706 elementor-column elementor-col-100 elementor-top-column\" data-id=\"185a706\" data-element_type=\"column\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-column-wrap  elementor-element-populated\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-wrap\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-10328fc elementor-author-box--layout-image-left elementor-author-box--align-left elementor-author-box--image-valign-top elementor-widget elementor-widget-author-box\" data-id=\"10328fc\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"author-box.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-author-box\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div  class=\"elementor-author-box__avatar\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"https:\/\/dduconnect.in\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/11\/LOKESH-300x300.jpeg\" alt=\"Lokesh Narwani\">\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-author-box__text\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div >\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3 class=\"elementor-author-box__name\">Lokesh Narwani<\/h3>\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-author-box__bio\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>EC, 4th Sem.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/section>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t",

It was all they could hear. Everyone in the courtroom could sense the nervousness in her demeanor. Fear and anxiety were written all over her face. The surroundings and the scrutinizing glances were completely new to the thirteen-year-old girl. Having lived a sheltered life for years, it was tough facing such a judgment alone for the first time.<\/p><p>As the judge arrived, all the whispers died. With a bored expression on his wrinkled face, he settled into his place and started the session. &#8220;Good morning ladies and gentlemen. The court is now in session. We call case no. 2468, Mr. Aakash Sharma versus Miss Meena Sharma. The accused is held against the charges of stealing 10, 00,000 rupees cash from Mr. Aakash Singh. So Miss Meena, what would you like to say in your defense?&#8221;<\/p><p>The betrayal from her dear ones caused her voice to choke. Unable to hold composure, she burst into tears. As though unmoved by her cries the old man spoke, &#8220;You have nothing to fear if you are right my child. Speak if you want to prove your innocence.\u201d Suddenly filled with determination, she wiped her tears and spoke, \u201cMy family used to live in a farm outside of the village. But due to crop failure, my father and mother committed suicide one day. None of my relatives came to help after.&#8221;<br \/>&#8220;What nonsense is this? Are we here for a trial or pity party? This is outrageous!&#8221; &#8220;Please Mr. Aakash, wait for your turn to speak. You continue, my child.&#8221; The judge spoke making the angry Aakash Sharma quiet. Meena continued in a broken tone, \u201cIt was very hard Sahib. No one was willing to let us stay in our home or enter school. The bank people came and confiscated the farm. I tried finding work but the times were hard, Sahib. Somehow I managed to feed my brother and sister. But with my parents, my luck also expired. I could only make 20 or 30 rupees per week doing odd jobs. I had two little siblings to feed, sahib. So I used to take some leftovers every day from Aakash Kaka&#8217;s shop. When I took the bread that day, my only thought was to feed something to my little Ansh who was suffering from fever from two days. I did not steal the money, Sahib. I only wanted food. Does this make me a thief judge Sahib?&#8221; asked Meena with glistening orbs, pleading for her innocence.<br \/>The courtroom was filled with silence once again. But this time the pre-teen did not feel the weight of judgmental stares. Instead, she felt everyone looking at her with an emotion which was almost, also there on the judge&#8217;s face- pity and sympathy. Some were even sobbing silently hearing the miserable tale. Except for one. The judge asked, &#8220;Would you like to say something, Mr. Aakash Sharma?&#8221;<br \/>&#8220;This girl is trying to fool everyone here, my lord. I very well know girls like her. A few tears here and there; they think anyone can be fooled. Taking pity to her condition and the fact that she is my niece, I adopted her. But she insisted on staying in the hut with her siblings. So I thought to let her stay in the daytime- so that she has food and clothes. Around a few weeks ago I started noticing articles missing from my home- cutlery, crockery, and some garments. Many times I found Meena giving longing looks to all the ornaments. It was only last week that I found her with a satchel containing food and some clothes. She must have stolen the money the same way. My lord, do not get carried away by her crocodile tears, look at the malice behind her eyes. I say check that tattered hut of hers, the money must surely be there&#8221;, he spat out with disdain coating his tone.<\/p><p>Gasps were heard in the courtroom upon the cruel statements and blatant accusations thrown at Meena. But she calmly presented her argument,\u201dMy lord I work at the house of my kaka as a maid. Only when he knew about my farm being named after my guardian, he took me in. I didn\u2019t steal anything from their house. If I really had cash with me, by now I would have fled the city with my siblings. But I am still here with my fever-ridden siblings.&#8221;<\/p><p>The judge judged the situation with a stoic expression on his face. He knew from years of experience what would the correct decision be. He announced it loud without a doubt, &#8220;The sentence of this young prisoner is for the present deferred.&#8221;<\/p><\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/section>\n\t\t\t\t<section class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-8079bd4 elementor-section-boxed elementor-section-height-default elementor-section-height-default elementor-section elementor-top-section\" data-id=\"8079bd4\" data-element_type=\"section\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-container elementor-column-gap-default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-row\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"aux-parallax-section elementor-element elementor-element-a6027ed elementor-column elementor-col-100 elementor-top-column\" data-id=\"a6027ed\" data-element_type=\"column\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-column-wrap  elementor-element-populated\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-wrap\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-4c880a3 elementor-author-box--layout-image-left elementor-author-box--align-left elementor-widget elementor-widget-author-box\" data-id=\"4c880a3\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"author-box.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-author-box\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div  class=\"elementor-author-box__avatar\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"https:\/\/dduconnect.in\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/11\/SUNAINA-300x300.jpeg\" alt=\"Sunayana Samavedam\">\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-author-box__text\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div >\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3 class=\"elementor-author-box__name\">Sunayana Samavedam<\/h3>\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-author-box__bio\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>EC, 4th Sem.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/section>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t",
