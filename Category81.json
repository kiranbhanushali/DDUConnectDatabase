Be it during a lecture or a long shower, falling into the pit of our thoughts is inevitable. It\u2019s remarkable, how we lose all consciousness when we are day-dreaming. No conversation could compare to the ones we have with ourselves.<br \/><\/strong><strong><br \/>We all have a unique way of communicating with ourselves. More precisely, we all have a language we do our thinking in. For most people, it is their native language. But not all thoughts have a language. Our brain has a lot of signals. From your lively smile to the tell-tale tears. From the bursting veins when you are furious, to the Goosebumps when you are nervous. Our brain informs us of our thoughts in several ways.<br \/><\/strong><strong><br \/>Have you ever wondered, what must new-borns think? Babies think all the time. Constantly absorbing information from everything that exists, and processing it. But they know no language. So what is the syntax of their thoughts? Just the thought of what goes in their tiny little heads baffles me. Their array of thoughts could be in the form of a diverse network, forming strategic links with each other, a process too complex to comprehend. Or the thoughts could be random signals that guide them. Their thoughts could never be put into words, because there are no words there!<br \/><\/strong><strong><br \/>These \u2018language-less\u2019 thoughts must have a pattern of their own too. The \u2018Language of Thought Hypothesis (LOTH)\u2019 describes thought process as a language which has grammar of its own. The hypothesis says that the brain follows simple rules which combine in various ways to build thoughts. But are thoughts so mathematical? How can something be so random and yet so symmetrical? Why have I taken for granted, this mysterious entity for so long? We are centuries away from understanding the human brain completely. And while there might be some truth to LOTH, the mechanism of thoughts shall remain shrouded in mystery as long as our brain is.<br \/><\/strong><strong><br \/>At this day of age, we know so much about ourselves, and yet we have barely scratched the surface. When we would have finally figured it all out, I believe that&#8217;s when we will reach the peak of discoveries. Or will we?<\/strong><\/p><\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/section>\n\t\t\t\t<section class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-dec633f elementor-section-boxed elementor-section-height-default elementor-section-height-default elementor-section elementor-top-section\" data-id=\"dec633f\" data-element_type=\"section\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-container elementor-column-gap-default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-row\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"aux-parallax-section elementor-element elementor-element-b290788 elementor-column elementor-col-100 elementor-top-column\" data-id=\"b290788\" data-element_type=\"column\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-column-wrap  elementor-element-populated\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-wrap\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-95f3505 elementor-author-box--layout-image-left elementor-author-box--align-left elementor-widget elementor-widget-author-box\" data-id=\"95f3505\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"author-box.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-author-box\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div  class=\"elementor-author-box__avatar\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"https:\/\/dduconnect.in\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/KHADIJA-300x300.jpg\" alt=\"Khadija Sidhpuri\">\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-author-box__text\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div >\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3 class=\"elementor-author-box__name\">Khadija Sidhpuri<\/h3>\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-author-box__bio\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>CE 5th Sem<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/section>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Several times a day we become completely detached from our surroundings and get lost deep in the recesses of our mind.

an unread message.<br \/><\/strong><strong><br \/>You might not know me since I am (literally) unread. Have you ever heard of an introvert getting ignored on a daily basis? Yeah, I&#8217;m the same species. I think, a problem well stated is a problem half solved. So here I present some irrefutable facts.<br \/><\/strong><strong><br \/>My existence can be in any form. I could either be your tenant reminding you to pay the rent, or your boss inquiring about your absence, or your annoying girlfriend wishing you a good morning or even a bank offer with terms and conditions. My lifespan can be in the range of two days to forever. One time, my fellow receiver, who happened to be a mom ignored a text from her kid saying \u201cMom, Rhea burnt the garden down\u201d for three hours. But it&#8217;s not her fault I guess. Maybe she thought it was a prank. Had it been a voice call, the kid might&#8217;ve howled, sending the mother rushing towards the precious greens. Hence why, in a world full of superfluous gifs, jpegs and voice mails, I am an omnipresent yet a crass form of media.<br \/><\/strong><strong><br \/>I have quite a miserable life really. It&#8217;s as if the receiver greets me with \u201cI&#8217;m really sorry I didn&#8217;t say hi, make eye contact or acknowledge your presence in any way when you waved at me in the hallway the other day. It&#8217;s nothing personal. I just have too many people trying to greet me these days, and I can&#8217;t respond to everyone.\u201d But at least it&#8217;s better than \u201cI&#8217;m too busy to answer your email, your email is not a priority for me right now.\u201d<br \/><\/strong><strong><br \/>And how do you know if a message you&#8217;ve received doesn&#8217;t deserve a response anyway? My friend \u201cNotification\u201d here, is terrific! He tells people, rather notifies them and even states the message in brief. Like a title to an essay. Buddy if you&#8217;re reading this, I&#8217;m quite upset okay?<br \/><\/strong><strong><br \/>The other day, we had this casual meet when the phone ran out of battery. Mr Gif said that he is really praised by the users. Mute, yet subtle. And we discussed about how people get excited about images and videos that they leave their assigned work and scurry off to open the chat. Even in math class! Miss facetime is the most celebrated media of all. Everyone just wishes to be like her.<br \/><\/strong><strong><br \/>But sometimes I feel I&#8217;m liked by the person not reading me. It could be a student avoiding an email of exam results, or a message from dad asking to call back as soon as possible, or an editor trying to avoid a deadline. Like yesterday, this fellow avoided a text saying, \u201cbro plz pick me up 2morrow.\u201d Yes, I know the English drives people up the wall, but the poor guy wanted a ride. But I guess it&#8217;s just a matter of priorities. He ignored the text and I felt I was appreciated at that time.<br \/><\/strong><strong><br \/>But hey! At least I&#8217;m not ignored as much as the warnings after compiling a program.<br \/><\/strong><strong><br \/>Anyway, I&#8217;ll get going.

The room is filled with my guests. The sight of such pristine individuals makes goosebumps to crawl up my arms. My humongous hall seems to narrow down as the chitter-chatter grows louder with each of my steps forward.<br \/><br \/>Against the vintage wallpaper, a lady\u2019s diamond crown stands out. The air around her smells of success and poise. My long-gone adolescent self leaves me with a burnt mark as she tries to push through my chest only to cower back in, ones under the iridescent shadow of the pageant queen. Tearing my eyes away from her I push my way further into the hall.<br \/><br \/>Some of my guests show signs of familiarity in meeting my gaze. My whole being starts to perish gradually as I remember the reason behind sending them an invitation. Hazy visions of sitting in a lonely park swing clutching my Math paper filled with red marks and the salty taste of tears on my chapped lips cross my mind. The vision is replaced with that of a classroom where the younger version of one of my guests smiles proudly as she walks towards her seat with a chorus of resounding claps from our peers and teacher. A wave of bitter nostalgia hits me as memories of my guests outperforming me in all phases of life comes crashing down on my fragile self. My shoulders droop down as the burden of self-loathing doubles up. Turning my sneering face away, I take heavy steps further into the abyss of my insecurities.<br \/><br \/>The presence of these accomplished individuals reignites the green flame in my heart. Shadows of my elders start manifesting out of thin air. I jerk up a bit as these shadows mummer old saying and quotes from the Holy Book in my ears while floating around me. I push past those Holy words and near my inevitable destruction. As malice starts clouding my eyes my throat turns dry and a revolting taste fills my mouth. I succumb to my evil intentions and growl at my guest. I try to claw out their intelligence and beauty, their benevolence and strength and rub it harshly on my skin, trying to merge it in my meagre self, desperately hoping for a miracle.<br \/><br \/>The marble floor beneath me shakes violently as my actions worsen. My insides churn and my core burns up as the cloud of disappointment around my elders grows larger. A pungent odour fills my hall. Fear creeps up as my beautiful walls start to crumble down. I try to crawl away but the burden of decade\u2019s worth of self-loathing and malevolence halts me as I wait for my imminent demise.<br \/><br \/>Invidia is one of the Seven Deadly Sins in Christian belief. It is the Latin word for Envy. Invidia is shown as a Roman goddess to personify Envy. She is drawn with a serpent coiled around her breast and biting her heart, to signify \u201cshe was herself her torment\u201d.<\/strong><\/p><\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/section>\n\t\t\t\t<section class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-02ba62d elementor-section-boxed elementor-section-height-default elementor-section-height-default elementor-section elementor-top-section\" data-id=\"02ba62d\" data-element_type=\"section\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-container elementor-column-gap-default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"aux-parallax-section elementor-element elementor-element-b6e65e0 elementor-column elementor-col-100 elementor-top-column\" data-id=\"b6e65e0\" data-element_type=\"column\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-wrap elementor-element-populated\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-bf56073 elementor-author-box--layout-image-left elementor-author-box--align-left elementor-widget elementor-widget-author-box\" data-id=\"bf56073\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"author-box.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-author-box\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div  class=\"elementor-author-box__avatar\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"https:\/\/dduconnect.in\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/Divyashree-Iyer-sen.-edi.-300x300.jpg\" alt=\"Divyashree iyer\">\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-author-box__text\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div >\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3 class=\"elementor-author-box__name\">Divyashree iyer<\/h3>\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-author-box__bio\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>IT Batch 2018<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/section>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Two majestic mahogany doors lead me into a hall lit with numerous incandescent light bulbs.

How does it feel to be the one who isn\u2019t wanted anywhere? To stay amid in-crowd, like a silent cry. No one thinks you are capable of being kind enough. All these empathizers always keep on criticizing you for what you did to them. Your existence matters only at the expense of others absence. Today was the second time I was meeting you. Our meeting was not \u2018The Good\u2019 one but neither was it bad.<\/strong><\/p><p><strong>I had first met you in my grandfather\u2019s eyes. There you were curled up in the corner like an infant in a mother\u2019s womb and taking notes of everything you observed. You took measured breaths, with every passing day you have grown weaker and a little broken-hearted. I had convinced myself that we won\u2019t meet again, but there you are right in front of me. Though I couldn\u2019t see you clearly as the water was blurring my vision but still I was able to recognise you.<br \/><\/strong><strong><br \/>It was becoming difficult for me to breathe as I descended further into the ocean, my hands and legs had started becoming numb and my brain had stopped working. That was the time I realised it was finally the time to meet you &#8211; \u2018Death\u2019. Now I understood why were you yelled at and not liked by anyone. My brain started processing it all and had listed down every possible reason to dislike you. You staring at my eyes directed my focus to the last borrowed breathes I have before you take them away from me.<\/strong><br \/><strong><br \/>And since it\u2019s our last meet let me tell you that you hurt people very badly. Sometimes even make them bleed in colours they never thought they had. Whatever you do the stink doesn\u2019t go off your skin. You will always be in my memories and it\u2019s said that memories don\u2019t fade away, likewise, you will also be remembered.<br \/><\/strong><strong><br \/>Although I know I have a few breaths left, but still, I have a few questions for you. Does your voice break when you hear the first cry of a new-born child? Do you smile at all those people who have a lifetime to live? Are you worried about meeting them again? Have you ever fallen in love with the person whose life you are about to end?<br \/>Ignoring all the sad part, lastly, I have realised, it\u2019s who you are and there is no way you can change yourself, and neither can our opinions. We both have to live with it. No, wait, not me, but you. But don\u2019t get upset because people fear you or break you down, because it\u2019s in human nature to fear from things they can\u2019t understand. Just ignore them and remember that without you \u2018The Cycle of Life\u2019 would be incomplete.<\/strong><\/p><\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/section>\n\t\t\t\t<section class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-70b2438 elementor-section-boxed elementor-section-height-default elementor-section-height-default elementor-section elementor-top-section\" data-id=\"70b2438\" data-element_type=\"section\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-container elementor-column-gap-default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"aux-parallax-section elementor-element elementor-element-bffc1fb elementor-column elementor-col-100 elementor-top-column\" data-id=\"bffc1fb\" data-element_type=\"column\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-wrap elementor-element-populated\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-80930fe elementor-author-box--layout-image-left elementor-author-box--align-left elementor-widget elementor-widget-author-box\" data-id=\"80930fe\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"author-box.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-author-box\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div  class=\"elementor-author-box__avatar\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"https:\/\/dduconnect.in\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/AASTHA-300x300.jpg\" alt=\"Aastha Patel\">\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-author-box__text\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div >\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3 class=\"elementor-author-box__name\">Aastha Patel<\/h3>\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-author-box__bio\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>CE Batch 2018<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/section>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>How does it feel to be always yelled at for doing what you are meant to?

I put the second cup of coffee with exactly one shot of espresso on the table beside my computer. For coffee is my only friend these long nights, keeping me to my senses. The surrounding is illuminated by the occasional appearance of moonlight from behind the clouds. I take a sip from the coffee mug with words \u201cBegin. Period.\u201d embedded on it. The caffeine hit my mind like cold water waking me from a deep slumber and my hands instantly move towards my keyboard. I begin to type but my fingers keep hovering over the home row keys without pressing them. I had never wondered that pressing an enter key will be such a time-consuming task. Still clouded with doubts, I hit the enter key anyway, with a force, I fear, would have rendered the key unusable. Luckily, it remained intact.<\/p><p>The code started compiling. With a hope that the long process will yield a \u201cSuccessfully Completed\u201d result on my first try, I went on a reminiscing hiatus. I have always liked stories; the way it takes you on a ride of adventures and action had me begging to join the protagonist on their adventure every time. One such story that is close to my heart begins with \u201cHello, World!\u201d. It was in my junior year of high school when I was introduced to the real world of computers. The Linux environment, using the commands to navigate to my first text editor-Vim, writing my first program in C language, had me already flying in cloud nine. By the time I got \u201cHello, World!\u201d printing successfully on the terminal, I was hitherto pledging my alliance to the eternal geekhood. Since then, my days have gone by getting lost in the acrid smell of the pages of books and my nights, in the execution of whatever ideas I could muster from them. As such, I go on to lengths to consider myself an artist. Just like a writer devotes a greater of their time in finding the perfect set of words to make the sentence and the entire story meaningful, I spend hours looking for a name that can perfectly describe a variable, a method or a class. A satisfactory name brings with it a brisk summer breeze while otherwise brings the grit and wails. As I go on to create complex components, the functions become no more than the shades in a painting that contributes to a masterpiece.<\/p><p>I do not realise that my eyes have been subconsciously fixated on the monitor until it suddenly barges me with the white lines of text filling up the terminal. Alas, the compilation was unsuccessful. Like a frowned writer, I go on to find the plothole in my story. I make some modifications, compile it and then change some of it again. Occasionally, the night feels more alive when the output message yields successful. The process iterates and my life goes on.\u00a0<\/p><\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/section>\n\t\t\t\t<section class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-b153d55 elementor-section-boxed elementor-section-height-default elementor-section-height-default elementor-section elementor-top-section\" data-id=\"b153d55\" data-element_type=\"section\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-container elementor-column-gap-default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-row\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"aux-parallax-section elementor-element elementor-element-592ef88 elementor-column elementor-col-100 elementor-top-column\" data-id=\"592ef88\" data-element_type=\"column\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-column-wrap  elementor-element-populated\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-wrap\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-b90b576 elementor-author-box--layout-image-left elementor-author-box--align-left elementor-widget elementor-widget-author-box\" data-id=\"b90b576\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"author-box.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-author-box\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div  class=\"elementor-author-box__avatar\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"https:\/\/dduconnect.in\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/11\/UTSAV-300x300.jpeg\" alt=\"Utsav Parmar\">\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-author-box__text\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div >\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3 class=\"elementor-author-box__name\">Utsav Parmar<\/h3>\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-author-box__bio\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>CE, 6th Sem.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/section>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>It\u2019s one o&#8217; clock in the morning.

First day! Where is the class? Where is this particular lab? Rather than these normal questions I had to ask others that there was any literature club in this college. After a week\u2019s disappointment I discovered DDU Connect through its first event ever; Stretch-a-Tale. A few days later I shot several questions on the people with white shirts who had just finished the announcement of recruitment of Editorial team of DDU Connect, and here was the only chance of becoming the part of the journey that I\u2019m about to complete. Today, it is all about to end and let me look back at the journey.<\/p><p>After penning my first article, several insomniac nights followed but most importantly, I learned. With time, I learned to sail in the ocean of literature with the support of team-cum-family at Connect and finally, I sailed. It is not easy to settle for something you were not looking for but, it gives what you wanted indirectly. I never wished to write articles, only wished to write poems and explore the literary art and that too only for my solace. Anyhow, I was standing on the deck of this ship sailing through the ocean of literature, ready to become a literature pirate, ready to face the storms, hoping to pen down several poems and a storm hit.\u00a0<\/p><p>After a year of manifesting creativity, I was actually getting a role to play on the ship and I was so happy to contribute to the pirating activities carried on the ship. At Connect, being a literature pirates we love to create our own pearls to add to the ocean and not just collect that are already in the ocean. It is not always easy to be a pirate and here is when the aforementioned storm hit us. As we all know, pirates never giveup and so, we did not give up. Meanwhile everyone was busy building another ship, inking their imaginations, I was in my own world. I enjoyed reading what the pearls contained that I collected. I can never express my Gratitude to Connect for that time when I explored the inner beauties of the pearl I had collected. I had known more about the wonders of this ocean than I had known before. By that time, we had a new ship, stronger, more efficient and it had wings!<\/p><p>All these years we fell, got up, created pearls, transcended ingenuity, found a family, but mostimportantly learned. Being at Connect, I learned that nothing is impossible. With dedication and discipline every dream can become a happening reality. I learned that success, happiness, joy, all these are not destinations but these are journeys. It is truly said in the book The Hobbit, \u201cYou certainly usually find something, if you look, but it is not always quite the something you were after.\u201d Connect was the journey I found while looking for a literature club and I\u2019m happy for this. This journey I undertook three years ago, to become a literature pirate, is about to end. With last dot on this article, I retire from this ship as well initiated literature pirate.<\/p><p>\u2018Happily, Retired!\u2019\u00a0 \u00a0<\/p><\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/section>\n\t\t\t\t<section class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-b153d55 elementor-section-boxed elementor-section-height-default elementor-section-height-default elementor-section elementor-top-section\" data-id=\"b153d55\" data-element_type=\"section\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-container elementor-column-gap-default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-row\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"aux-parallax-section elementor-element elementor-element-592ef88 elementor-column elementor-col-100 elementor-top-column\" data-id=\"592ef88\" data-element_type=\"column\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-column-wrap  elementor-element-populated\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-wrap\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-b90b576 elementor-author-box--layout-image-left elementor-author-box--align-left elementor-widget elementor-widget-author-box\" data-id=\"b90b576\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"author-box.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-author-box\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div  class=\"elementor-author-box__avatar\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"https:\/\/dduconnect.in\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/11\/LOKESH-300x300.jpeg\" alt=\"Lokesh Narwani\">\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-author-box__text\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div >\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3 class=\"elementor-author-box__name\">Lokesh Narwani<\/h3>\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-author-box__bio\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>EC, 6th Sem.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/section>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Engineering college!

But these few second long footages take more efforts than one could ever anticipate. The process of the formation of a story starts long before it touches the internet. Whenever a daily user comes to know about an event taking place they put on their best outfit and stride out the door with a set mind to click as many pictures as possible. They find themselves smiling extra hard, posing with outward poise and making typical things look extravagant. Next pictures are taken of glasses raised up in the air, people standing in front of paintings of butterfly wings, acquaintances hugging each other like long lost friends, and one can\u2019t simply forget the mouth-watering delicacies. Boomerangs of people jumping in the air and wiggling their hips are taken. Short videos of trees passing by on the way or friends talking or singing during a car ride are taken where the change is key of the person\u2019s voice is noticeable.<\/p><p>After taking a ton of pictures and videos we sit down to select the best ones. But the story has to be uploaded on the very day. Doing that the next day is just not cool. Filters are added, a series of almost identical pictures are sent to the best friend, who helps in picking out the best one. Next carefully selected hashtags and small but quirky quotes are attached.<\/p><p>After carefully arranging the order of the stories and checking them for the final time the send button is hit. Even though the number of seen are visible to just one person the hope for getting more viewers doesn\u2019t diminish. Within a few minutes\u2019 reactions of the followers to the story starts. Some get a typed reply and some just get emojis. When a particular someone replies to a story uploaded just for them is the cherry on top.<\/p><p>And what if there are no events taking place, a trip to the grocery shop can even be made fun looking.<\/p><p>And if nothing works our way then a series on copied memes from the explore page are more than sufficient.<\/p><p>At the end of the given 24hr when we click on a round little button with our face on it and take a final look at the day&#8217;s events a satisfied smile spreads on our lips. With that thought and a good night selfie later we roll on the bed and mentally start planning the next day.

Take this and try it on and see if it fits you.\u201d My mom gestured holding up a pair of jeans in one hand, that vaguely resembled bell bottoms while making space for me to sit amidst piles of other such clothes that were probably seeking dust in her wardrobe since god knows when. I tried it on and to my surprise it fit so perfectly that I might have presumably been looking like she did when she must have worn it in her teens. It is said that old is gold. I preferably like to call it the opposite instead- old is priceless. Wearing mom\u2019s skirts and sarees, switching between dad\u2019s denim jackets and listening to retro songs of Jagjit Singh and Kishore Kumar on Sunday mornings, we all grew up. There\u2019s a song by \u2018The Trews\u2019 that proclaims that in the modern age, vintage love is the only true love. Vintage is indeed so peculiar to itself that the emotion and nostalgia associated with it is at an entirely different level.<\/p>\n<p>I don\u2019t remember how exactly we ended up with the vintage fad instead of loving the essence that the 21st century holds. Perhaps it was when the smell of the age old books that your granddad gave you long ago, that took you with it in its arms into the story world or when you began collecting the obsolete yet antique coins of your great great grandparents\u2019 times. There is but nothing as timeless as the black and white; now turned yellow photographs of our forebears, our veterans and the historical times. None of us apparently during our childhood liked watching the reel movies and songs that were played on Doordarshan that our parents made us watch. Frustrated, we would ask them to change it so we could watch something that our eyes felt good watching. Ironically, now we call them \u2018the classics\u2019. They are black and white, yet full of all colors of life that they portray so gracefully.<\/p>\n<p>I might in fact have been so influenced with the vogue that now hung posters of Elvis Presley, the Cranberries and Bob Marley songs all across my wardrobe. There is love, vanity, simplicity and history in vintage. Vintage is the memento that we carry with us to be reminded of all the good and bad times and peoples the world has ever seen. This love of vintage is endless and is going to be relished forever. They say, \u201cOlder the fiddle, finer the tune\u201d. If truth be told, exploring vintage is as overwhelming as the feeling one gets while flipping through pictures of their toddlerhood. Time goes by fast. We will soon become vintage relics for our posterity. Before that happens relive the past. I call myself a 90s kid.

family. Especially in India, the closeness and attachments we have for our family are very strong. It becomes twice as much when we grow up in a joint family. You must be wondering what it&#8217;s like to be in a joint family. Well ahoy! Come on down to the clown town!<\/p><p>My family for once, is like a circus. Every circus is defined by its ringmaster. Well in our case, the ringmaster is my grandfather. Talking to him always feels like walking on a thin rope. My grandmother being a juggler, having upper hand over everything and managing it without failure. But at the same time, she&#8217;s a doll from the doll house. My dad is like an acrobat. Never settling, one who always has to run errands and also provide for the family with the performance. My uncle here, can be any of those huge cute animals, like a bear. He&#8217;s always there to entertain, play with or even give free hugs! My mother and aunt being the safety net, always there to take my fall. My siblings are the dwarfs from the circus, as annoying as quacking ducks and extremely frenzy like monkeys. And how can I forget the giant elephant who&#8217;s most loved and is known for eating for eternity and eternity? It&#8217;s me ladies and gentlemen. I&#8217;m Apu for you.<\/p><p>Every circus is known for a performance which thrills the performers as well as the viewers. The most exciting thing about my family is dinner. It normally starts with us sitting at the table waiting for food, me arguing with my brother about table space and how he shouldn&#8217;t rest his hand in my territory, in the lowest voice possible because god forbid, if my dada comes to know, one of us is probably gonna end up eating in the backyard. My father &#8220;loosens&#8221; his belt to make space in the tummy, enough to let ten African kids starve. The dining table is silent for a while but actually it&#8217;s the silence before the thunder, until a family member presents opinions about the news of the previous day. Now I&#8217;m quite sure after this the neighbours probably think we&#8217;re having a contention, a huge family drama. But it&#8217;s quite literally on what to cook for lunch the next day. Then we talk about how we spent the day and at last me trying to forcibly gulp the eggplant down. Sigh!<\/p><p>If you live in a joint family, you&#8217;re always familiar with the cries of stubborn cousins and hollers of aged uncles, gossips of the girl gang and cricket matches of the dad club. There will be family members of different nature and temperament in one house. You are taught the invaluable lesson of sharing from an early age. As tiring and overly annoying it might seem, there are some little joys that you only experience when you grow up in a joint family. Like listening to the amazing stories your grandparents tell you isn&#8217;t a once in a while affair. There&#8217;s no end to the unparalleled moments with your cousins. Every family trip becomes a major larger-than-life event that turns into a celebration. When there&#8217;s a special occasion like a wedding or a festival, the entire home changes into a grand spectacle. And the biggest perk of all, there will never come a day when there&#8217;s absolutely no home cooked food.<\/p><p>If there ever comes a point when you need advice, you&#8217;ll get tons of insightful opinions. The phrase &#8220;all for one and one for all&#8221; is literally true and fitting in a joint family. At the end of the day, family is all you have and in a joint family, you get to cherish that fact every single day.<\/p><\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/section>\n\t\t\t\t<section class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-0283935 elementor-section-boxed elementor-section-height-default elementor-section-height-default elementor-section elementor-top-section\" data-id=\"0283935\" data-element_type=\"section\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-container elementor-column-gap-default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-row\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"aux-parallax-section elementor-element elementor-element-dd8acd7 elementor-column elementor-col-100 elementor-top-column\" data-id=\"dd8acd7\" data-element_type=\"column\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-column-wrap  elementor-element-populated\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-wrap\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-bd05f48 elementor-author-box--layout-image-left elementor-author-box--align-left elementor-widget elementor-widget-author-box\" data-id=\"bd05f48\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"author-box.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-author-box\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div  class=\"elementor-author-box__avatar\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"https:\/\/dduconnect.in\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/12\/icon-login-3.jpg-300x300.png\" alt=\"Priya Rathod\">\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-author-box__text\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div >\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3 class=\"elementor-author-box__name\">Priya Rathod<\/h3>\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-author-box__bio\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>IT 3rd SEM <\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/section>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>There&#8217;s nothing greater than a family.

I came back to my place with dozens of insipid journals. I had no clue where I was going to keep these in my messy room.<br \/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Instead of walking in the door and exhaling into relief, the calm I hoped for was met with even more stress as my eyes set upon the table which had a galore of things on it. Keeping the journals at a secured place in my room almost seemed impossible. I sat on my couch and looked around my room which made me realize that I had a plethora of things which I don\u2019t even use. My eyes met with the pile of magazines and novels which I had planned to read regularly a long while ago but never succeeded. A brown coloured stuffed teddy bear which had lost its eyes lied next to the stack of my Sherlock Holmes series. At that very moment, I realized something that even if the books are old and torn or even if my teddy has only its face left I won\u2019t ever throw it away. Creating space for journals seemed to have less priority then.<br \/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Inner me knew that I couldn\u2019t bear to lose these things. I wonder if it is just me; or everyone has the same feeling when we are asked to give up on something we clung onto for a long time.<br \/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We all have that special dress in our closet which we wore to a wedding five years ago, which probably would not fit us again but still we keep it. That watch which has stopped ticking centuries ago, but still has a reserved place in our drawers. That box of crayons which only serves the purpose of bringing back old memories has created its own space in our cupboards. We all have those kind of things in a drawer overflowing with every other stuff we didn\u2019t even know exist. Things which don\u2019t have value but are our secret tenacious treasures.<br \/>Why exactly can\u2019t we give up on these things? Are they really a treasure or something that encaptures our useful space. After giving a brief thought to it, I concluded that maybe we hold onto things which gives us hope. Sentiments and procrastination can also be the other two parameters. I guess our desire to hold onto piles and piles of old mementos can often be blamed on nostalgia. Maybe because reminiscing about the past makes us feel good.<br \/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou aren\u2019t what you own so don\u2019t let the things you own, own you.\u201d We all have heard these clich\u00e9s before. But are we even close to decluttering our treasures?<\/p><\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/section>\n\t\t\t\t<section class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-a179e2d elementor-section-boxed elementor-section-height-default elementor-section-height-default elementor-section elementor-top-section\" data-id=\"a179e2d\" data-element_type=\"section\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-container elementor-column-gap-default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-row\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"aux-parallax-section elementor-element elementor-element-62c25e7 elementor-column elementor-col-100 elementor-top-column\" data-id=\"62c25e7\" data-element_type=\"column\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-column-wrap  elementor-element-populated\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-wrap\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-aa03446 elementor-author-box--layout-image-left elementor-author-box--align-left elementor-widget elementor-widget-author-box\" data-id=\"aa03446\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"author-box.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-author-box\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div  class=\"elementor-author-box__avatar\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"https:\/\/dduconnect.in\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/12\/icon-login-3.jpg-300x300.png\" alt=\"Sruthi Cheruvullil\">\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-author-box__text\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div >\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3 class=\"elementor-author-box__name\">Sruthi Cheruvullil<\/h3>\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-author-box__bio\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>EC, 3rd Sem.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/section>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>After a long tedious day at college, I came back to my place with dozens of insipid journals.

joy.\u201d Those 3\u00bd minutes spent laughing hard every Sunday afternoon with my loved ones are a true manifestation of the quote above. It all happens when my seven-year-old brother brings us his potion, the elixir of euphoria, which he says is inspired from Harry Potter\u2019s elixir to induce euphoria but is heavier in dose than the original one as his potion causes hysteric laughter rather than excessive singing and nose-tweaking. It\u2019s a Sunday ritual now. He brings us his potion filled in glasses and sets them on the table set up in the backyard where we sit, stretch and relax. We never got to know or would ever get to know about his conspiracies behind making us drink it. We drink it anyway. My aunt cackles first, and then my mom goes all guffaws. I am sitting in my seat smirking at the craziness these people can portray and already thinking about the acts of lunacy about to come up. Until this time, my dad would be chortling and my uncle would have begun to howl. Watching them, I would lose it and go complete hysterics. All in all, we would be roaring with laughter, not because of the drink instead watching each other belly laugh as though we might just end up killing ourselves. The little guy stands there, grinning on the outside but seemingly perplexed on the inside pondering perhaps over the overacting we do. \u201cHow can adults be so stupid? It\u2019s just water.\u201d We all have the greatest of times whenever this young fellow joins in.<br \/>With a blown-up mind and in an utter state of euphoria, I asked the little guy on one such Sunday evening, though with no real intent of knowing the answer, rather to just strike a sweet, heart-warming conversation, \u201cHow is it that Harry Potter seemed to inspire you to forge this delightful elixir of yours?\u201d He said, \u201cYou guys. Watching every one of you laugh out loud, with all the power present within; it\u2019s refreshing, exciting and satisfying. As if we have escaped reality and travelled to some other dimension where it\u2019s only us, and I can only think of keeping all of you happy forever.\u201d Whether or not one such potion exists for real, I am not sure. What seemed lucid in that very moment was his unmistakable rectitude to find new ways to express his love for his family.

very vital role in my development. With every chapter, the connection built with the characters of the book keeps on getting stronger and when the book has me completely drowned in it, the next thing I realize is that I have reached the last chapter. I know that the strings of connection, tightened with so many difficulties, are loosening but, I still want to read the last chapter so badly that I cannot resist and go on to finish it. A couple of pages and everything comes to an end, but what lasts with me forever are those invisible strings. Although the knots begin to loosen after a while, yet they are tightly tied to a corner of my mind and I try my best to hold onto them.<\/strong><\/p><p><strong>One such congenial book, for me, is DDU Connect. Although I consider it as a book, it is very different than any other book. I have reached its last chapter, but every single cell of my brain and heart is prompting me to not read the last chapter. They simply aren\u2019t prepared for the end yet; although it is known that I am one of the co-authors of this chapter. If they could stop the sands of time, they definitely would have. Just like I can never resist reading the last chapter, I won\u2019t be able to elude this one too, only, this would not be my will. Knowing that this side of the wall is more pretty, I would want to stand on the other side of it, because I know that I will still have people with me who will make the other side as pretty as this one for me.<\/strong><\/p><p><strong>A thousand pictures with the same people but, all telling a different tale of a different time. Our phones would surely have run out of memory if it wasn\u2019t for the Cloud providing unlimited storage. The pictures may not have been clicked at the perfect time, but they were all captured at times which were perfect. After a few years, when all of us would be away from each other, in different corners of the world, yet just a call way, these are going to be the pictures that we will all look at and have our eyes filled with tears of nostalgia. With tears swiftly rolling down our cheeks, our faces would have a wide smile remembering the silly reason for which we were smiling in the pictures.<\/strong><\/p><p><strong>All I want is nothing more but to hear a knock at my door on a fine Saturday morning after a tiring week of work, only to find the characters from this book that we call CONNECT, when I open the door. I cannot fathom how the last chapter of that book would be! I don\u2019t know if I will be able to write it or not, but I am so sure that I definitely want to start it. After all, it is about time.<\/strong><\/p><\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/section>\n\t\t\t\t<section class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-2e79289 elementor-section-boxed elementor-section-height-default elementor-section-height-default elementor-section elementor-top-section\" data-id=\"2e79289\" data-element_type=\"section\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-container elementor-column-gap-default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-row\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"aux-parallax-section elementor-element elementor-element-4aa3ec1 elementor-column elementor-col-100 elementor-top-column\" data-id=\"4aa3ec1\" data-element_type=\"column\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-column-wrap  elementor-element-populated\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-wrap\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-7025341 elementor-author-box--layout-image-left elementor-author-box--align-left elementor-widget elementor-widget-author-box\" data-id=\"7025341\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"author-box.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-author-box\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div  class=\"elementor-author-box__avatar\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"https:\/\/dduconnect.in\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/11\/HARSHIL-300x300.jpeg\" alt=\"Harshil Kapadiya\">\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-author-box__text\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div >\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3 class=\"elementor-author-box__name\">Harshil Kapadiya<\/h3>\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-author-box__bio\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>CE, 6th Sem.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/section>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Books have always played a very vital role in my development.

The sand is turning dark, the birds are returning from the horizon and the sun has already submerged halfway into the ocean. The scene is ever so clich\u00e9 but my heart strains to fathom all of this into a bunch of random words, hoping it would turn out to be something meaningful. At times like this, I go far enough to fancy myself as a writer.<\/strong><\/p><p><strong>I go showing my pieces to my friends, who are too nice to say anything but \u2018nice\u2019. They would say that I write good and it is something beyond them, that it is enough. This ought to invoke a dubious sense of self-worth, of satisfaction; and brassy satisfaction is a hindrance to bringing out the best. So, I get outside of my little bubble and read. I read the stories that have made people immortal, the poems that have made their way into everyone\u2019s heart and I wonder. I wonder if I can even write. And I fall into an intense discussion with myself that seems to go on for days, with no sign of conclusion in sight. I stop writing, and then, after some time I start it again. At the very least, I pick up the pen. After sitting quietly for hours, and letting my mind get clouded by the feeling of inferiority sired from reading the works of great art, finally the pen touches the paper and the result is only a mere dot. So I ask others, \u201cHow do you write so well?\u201d Some answer sincerely, some wittily, while some quote Peter De Vries, \u201cWrite drunk, edit sober.\u201d After trying all of their methods and realizing that nothing works on me, I sit and just write. I convince myself that I do not write for others but myself. So I don\u2019t have to be that good at it, let alone great.<\/strong><\/p><p><strong>I write because my heart is choked up with sentiments and ideas. I write because the touch of a pen sends shivers through my body and the white paper compels me to unleash the thoughts. One must understand that art underpins writing. To quote John Keating, \u201cWe do not read and write poetry because it is cute. We read and write poetry because we are members of the human race.\u201d Words can heal and hurt, but writing is much more than just words. It is symphony and dance and gibberish and harmony. The commas and apostrophes speak just as much as words. It is where the fingers transpose and blend the spaces between eyes and pages, to extort the soul and sentience out of writings. That is where the magic happens. When I\u2019m out in the real world, looking at my magic, I believe I can write. Then I read and contravene myself. I write, anyway.<\/strong><\/p><\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/section>\n\t\t\t\t<section class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-24760ad elementor-section-boxed elementor-section-height-default elementor-section-height-default elementor-section elementor-top-section\" data-id=\"24760ad\" data-element_type=\"section\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-container elementor-column-gap-default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-row\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"aux-parallax-section elementor-element elementor-element-da05878 elementor-column elementor-col-100 elementor-top-column\" data-id=\"da05878\" data-element_type=\"column\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-column-wrap  elementor-element-populated\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-wrap\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-833e146 elementor-author-box--layout-image-left elementor-author-box--align-left elementor-author-box--image-valign-middle elementor-widget elementor-widget-author-box\" data-id=\"833e146\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"author-box.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-author-box\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div  class=\"elementor-author-box__avatar\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"https:\/\/dduconnect.in\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/11\/UTSAV-300x300.jpeg\" alt=\"Utsav Parmar\">\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-author-box__text\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div >\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3 class=\"elementor-author-box__name\">Utsav Parmar<\/h3>\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-author-box__bio\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>CE, 4th Sem.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/section>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I\u2019m sitting on a bench.

data-test=\"textbox\">After finishing a long battle with studies at school, my worn out soul was screaming for solace. I pedaled in search of familiarity and suddenly a tantalizing aroma hypnotised my limbs to move towards its source. My mom had prepared kidney beans curry with steamed rice as a reward for finally scoring ninety &#8211; six in mathematics. That was the day when I decided to try recreate some of the magic she does in the kitchen.<\/p><p class=\"_3ziulaHePS\" dir=\"ltr\" data-test=\"textbox\">There have been many trials and errors since that day. Steamed rice was first on my to &#8211; accomplish list as I hail from Southern part of India. But forgetting to pour water in the pressure cooker pan caused a blast bigger than those at Diwali. Since then, my mother has not allowed me to enter the kitchen without parental guidance. Gradually, I made progress from destroying the cookware to creating burnt brown residue. Some kind of twisted Midas touch might have possessed me as I could transform any dish into inedible mess.<\/p><p class=\"_3ziulaHePS\" dir=\"ltr\" data-test=\"textbox\">My mother could not see her workplace being wrecked by my determination to cook. So, she introduced me to the world of culinary arts. Cooking in many ways, I then discovered is a scientific process. First you need to make hypothetical assumptions what kind of textures and flavours would go together. Then comes verification with the help of existing theorems. Here, it includes pre tasting of raw materials to predict how they would suit the recipe. The next step involves measuring and experimenting. All ingredients get mixed in measured proportions and temperature variations are carried to obtain a balanced output. Finally we have the evaluation where mistakes made in various processes are found. This is found out by judging looks and taste. Results of this analysis are used to then correct the faults in assumptions. But it differs from other scientific processes as you can always add a bit of your imagination while experimenting.<\/p><p class=\"_3ziulaHePS\" dir=\"ltr\" data-test=\"textbox\">Cooking together as a team is a great bonding activity. All strengths are utilized and weaknesses covered together. Chopping, marinating, saut\u00e9, grilling , frying, baking and garnishing are then assigned accordingly. Coordination with each other is important as different processes consume different time intervals. At the end when all sit together to eat, some of the most cherished memories are made.<\/p><p class=\"_3ziulaHePS\" dir=\"ltr\" data-test=\"textbox\">When you cook something for your dear ones, extra ingredient are added to the dish like affection and care. When you cook their favourite dish, all you care about is the smile as they taste the food. . Unless you start living on your own, you don&#8217;t realize the difference this special ingredient makes. But not many are lucky to have at least one square meal. So if we could make a meal for the needy once in a while, won&#8217;t it be a step towards eradicating world hunger?<\/p><\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/section>\n\t\t\t\t<section class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-9a0dc86 elementor-section-boxed elementor-section-height-default elementor-section-height-default elementor-section elementor-top-section\" data-id=\"9a0dc86\" data-element_type=\"section\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-container elementor-column-gap-default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-row\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"aux-parallax-section elementor-element elementor-element-7281340 elementor-column elementor-col-100 elementor-top-column\" data-id=\"7281340\" data-element_type=\"column\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-column-wrap  elementor-element-populated\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-wrap\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-36f1925 elementor-author-box--layout-image-left elementor-author-box--align-left elementor-widget elementor-widget-author-box\" data-id=\"36f1925\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"author-box.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-author-box\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div  class=\"elementor-author-box__avatar\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"https:\/\/dduconnect.in\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/11\/SUNAINA-300x300.jpeg\" alt=\"Sunayana Samavedam\">\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-author-box__text\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div >\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3 class=\"elementor-author-box__name\">Sunayana Samavedam<\/h3>\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-author-box__bio\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>EC, 4th Sem.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/section>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>After finishing a long battle with studies at school, my worn out soul was screaming for solace.

data-test=\"textbox\">It was clear to me what it meant when I saw the elements of nature coming up against each other, an everlasting war. I sat on the shore and watched the waves emerging from their mother, the sea and crashing into the mighty rocks. A sad circumstance that was seemingly real, had carved its place in my mind.<\/p><p class=\"_3ziulaHePS\" dir=\"ltr\" data-test=\"textbox\">The dawn was nearing at the time and due to strong winds, the waves seemed more daunting than ever. They charged at the rocks with warrior cries that could be heard miles away from the war. Their enemy, the land didn&#8217;t flinch seeing the waves coming towards him. He seemed to trust his defences. The rocks sure were old and weathered but their experience of the war was older than the life itself. They were there at the time when the war started. On the other hand, the waves were just children whose souls were filled with only fury and determination. They were born only a few seconds ago and will die, perhaps in a minute or so. It was as if their sole purpose of being born was to defeat their mother&#8217;s age old enemy. It was a disheartening sight, but then war always is. It was hard to contemplate how the sea bore the loss of her children. No one knew what mysterious forces and events had led to the starting of the war but the sea seemed obdurate to be the one to end it. She sent forth her children day and night for years to the frontier to attack the rocks until they finally break. For the children, death was a small sacrifice they were willing to pay for their mother&#8217;s resolve. It was a despairing realisation and I couldn&#8217;t help but have contempt for the sea.<\/p><p class=\"_3ziulaHePS\" dir=\"ltr\" data-test=\"textbox\">Someone else also seemed to share my discontent with the circumstances. The sun, who was known to be secretly in love with the sea, was a witness of the war. Just when he was about to hide beneath the sea, his pale orange eyes met mine. They were tired and reflected great sorrow into the sea. He certainly had a story to tell. In those brief moments, we had a conversation with our eyes. It broke his heart to see the children die for what he thought was a futile war. He was about to say his final goodbye when as if for the final time, he shone with hope. He seemed to share his hopes for the future of the children to me. When he was gone, I suddenly had this notion that he had been helping them escape the war all along. After all, those children can take different forms.<\/p><\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/section>\n\t\t\t\t<section class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-c3bd8a2 elementor-section-boxed elementor-section-height-default elementor-section-height-default elementor-section elementor-top-section\" data-id=\"c3bd8a2\" data-element_type=\"section\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-container elementor-column-gap-default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-row\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"aux-parallax-section elementor-element elementor-element-9f3c61d elementor-column elementor-col-100 elementor-top-column\" data-id=\"9f3c61d\" data-element_type=\"column\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-column-wrap  elementor-element-populated\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-wrap\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-de06d00 elementor-author-box--layout-image-left elementor-author-box--align-left elementor-author-box--image-valign-middle elementor-widget elementor-widget-author-box\" data-id=\"de06d00\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"author-box.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-author-box\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div  class=\"elementor-author-box__avatar\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"https:\/\/dduconnect.in\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/11\/PARTH-P-300x300.jpeg\" alt=\"Parth Patel\">\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-author-box__text\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div >\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3 class=\"elementor-author-box__name\">Parth Patel<\/h3>\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-author-box__bio\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>IT, 4th Sem.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/section>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>It was clear to me what it meant when I saw the elements of nature coming up against each other, an everlasting war.

aka holiday. My plan to sleep-in till noon had to be disbanded when I got a call from work to show up at the workplace immediately. I was hoping for a crazy stream of mad colleagues running here and there to get everything done as soon as possible. Only, the scene was quite unusual and unsettling. Their faces were covered in poster colours, and their mood seemed to be in a merry state despite being called on a holiday. Their hands were full of paintbrushes and crayons. It seemed like they were enjoying every moment while creating posters and banners- as was the assigned task. It was strange because it was very different from our workline and yet, everyone was loving it. I still wasn\u2019t able to find the reason behind such behaviour of theirs. Before I could know, I had been given a similar task and was stroking a brush dipped in blue colour down the poster. Soon, I too was covered in different colours. The intoxicatingly acrid smell slowly coating me sent me on a trip down memory lane.<\/p><p>The stroll down the memory lane was quite nostalgic. For it brought the sweet memories I made during my childhood with those crayons and oil pastels, back to the conscious part of my brain. I was gradually getting soaked in the rainstorm of my very own memories, till an ironic sun called \u2018life\u2019 broke the storm. It was like being thrown in a world I had for long, forgotten had existed; all this while executing the allocated task. All these overwhelming feelings were mutual, and the reason as to why everyone had a smile on their faces despite the colour stains on their expensive shirts, eventually became clear to me.<\/p><p>From childhood to geezerhood, life is but a collection of electromagnetic radiation over a visible region with each beam of certain energy representing a different shade of life. Those colours are there with us in every moment of our life, through our every mood-shifts. If you think of the way certain emotions are described, there\u2019s no denying that colour and mood are inextricably linked. Open a sunny yellow umbrella, and some of the sunniness will undoubtedly rub off on you. \u2018Hot as Red,\u2019 \u2018Easy being Green\u2019 and such several other phrases aren\u2019t very unknown to us. Besides our eyes, the power of colours can be felt through ears and touch also, that is, ultimately through the heart. You subconsciously ascribe colours to people you\u2019ve met and to the songs you listen to. Even after all this, we kind of overlook it.
